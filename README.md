# The RoBotanist

This Project was created by Reuben Brandt, Dave Spivey, Pete Lowe, and Timur Catakli as a final project in Dev BootCamp.


## Usage

This project is hosted at www.robotanist.herokuapp.com

Key:
1) There are two simple starting points for RoBotanist.  You can either start from the very beginning of the key, or if you know the botanical family of your sample, you can enter it into the smart search box on the landing page.

2) RoBotanist pairs the dichotomies in the Jepson Manual for easy viewing.  As with any other dichotomous key, compare your sample to the available choices.




## History

The inspiration for the project came from Reuben's experience using the Jepson Manual to identify plants. While the information in the Jepson Manual is second to none, Reuben often found himself losing his place in the key, or encountering an unfamiliar word, which required additional resources. The goal of this project is to improve the user experience of the Jepson Manual, while maintaining the remarkable quality of the resource.
