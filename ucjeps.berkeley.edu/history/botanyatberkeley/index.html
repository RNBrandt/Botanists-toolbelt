This historical sketch was originally prepared as an illustrated lecture for a
departmental colloquium given on November 7, 1975. In seeking a short
and lively title for the colloquium, I chose one that may seem pretentious.
The emphasis here is on the Department of Botany. The title chosen was
not meant to minimize in any way the excellent work in plant science that
has been done elsewhere on the campus particularly in departments of the
then College of Agriculture, now College of Natural Resources. This topic
is left to better qualified biographers.
<br />
<br />
It is manifestly impossible for me to mention all persons who have
contributed to or who are now contributing to the distinction of the
Department of Botany. I have, therefore, tended to represent the faculty
exhaustively and other staff members highly selectively.
<br />
<br />
This sketch is dedicated to the memory of Leonard Machlis 
(1915-1976), who conceived and encouraged the project throughout, and to that
of Lee Bonar (1891-1977), who did most of the research on the earlier
period in connection with the University of California Centennial.
<br />
<br />
I wish to thank the following persons for their invaluable assistance:
Dr. Marion Cave and her departmental picture gallery; Mr. James Kantor,
University Archivist, and his archives; Mr. Richard Hafner, of the Public
Affairs Office, and his &ldquo;morgue&rdquo;; and Mrs. Alice Howard and Miss Alta
Pray for typing, editing, correcting, and providing many other forms of
help. Finally, I am most appreciative of the decision of Chancellor Albert
H. Bowker, at the request of Chairman Machlis and with the endorsement
of Provost Park, to make possible the printing of this history. <br />

The First Hundred Years </span><span class="bodyText"><br />
<br />
The University of California had its beginnings in the private College of
California, which was incorporated in Oakland in 1855, only six years after
the Gold Rush, and which opened in 1860. Tuition was $40 per year, and
other expenses, including room and board, were estimated at about $200
annually. The Reverend F. D. Hodgson was named Instructor in Mathematics 
and Natural History for 1861-63, but what he taught is problematical. 
William H. Brewer, the principal botanist of the California State
Geological Survey, was named Professor of Natural Science in 1863 and he
did give a course in chemistry later that year, but he left shortly thereafter
to accept the position of Professor of Agricultural Geology at Yale.
<br />
<br />
The year 1868 marked the actual establishment of the University of
California by the merger of the College of California with a proposed State
Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College, which had been authorized 
by the State Legislature two years earlier. Classes continued to meet
on the Oakland campus while the site for the University was being readied
in Berkeley. <br />
<br />
The first undoubted botanical instructor to grace the new institution
was Joseph LeConte, M.D., who appears as Professor of Geology, Natural
History and Botany in the roster for 1869-70. He was a Southerner who
first practiced medicine, then took a Harvard degree in geology under
Louis Agassiz, and subsequently taught at Oglethorpe, Franklin College,
and Southern Carolina College before embarking upon his notable career
in California. LeConte announced on his arrival: &ldquo;The course of lectures
in this Department [i.e., geology and natural history] will commence in
this class with Botany. In this first term Structural Botany is taken up, and
in the second term the Physiology of Vegetable Growth and Reproduction,
and the principles of classification of plants. The course is fully
illustrated by the use of the microscope. Text Book: Gray&rsquo;s <em>Structural and
Systematic Botany</em>.&rdquo; Originally the botany class met for one two-hour
session weekly for one term, but by 1874-75 the course had become a 
two-semester offering. <br />
<br />
President Daniel Coit Gilman pleaded in his report for 1872-73 for &ldquo;a
professor whose province it is to teach the Laws of Vegetation&mdash;all that
pertains to the growth and structure of plants, or Botany; in its scientific
and economic aspects; and there should also be a competent gardener, and
perhaps a forester employed at once to take charge of the grounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;
His report also included a letter from Asa Gray urging establishment of an
arboretum to parallel the Arnold Arboretum then being organized in
Massachusetts by Charles Sargent. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, across the bay in San Francisco, the California College of
Pharmacy was founded in 1872 with Hans H. Behr as Professor of Botany.
The College of Pharmacy became affiliated with the University the following
year, but Behr, a German-born physician and political emigr&eacute;, did not
come to the East Bay, although the Regents made him Emeritus Professor
of Botany in 1894. <br />
<br />
Also in 1873 the University moved to the Berkeley campus, with its two
new buildings. For many years botany lectures were given at 7:30 on
Thursday evenings; daylight demonstrations were given on alternate
Monday mornings, and &ldquo;all students were urged [but apparently not
compelled] to attend.&rdquo;
<br />
<br />
The College of Agriculture and the Agricultural Experiment Station
were officially launched in 1875, with the appointment of Eugene W.
Hilgard, a German soil scientist with a Ph.D. from Heidelberg. Hilgard
himself taught botany as a sophomore course from 1875 to 1882, 
apparently much as LeConte had done before him, using Gray&rsquo;s text and
illustrating his lectures &ldquo;by the use of the magic lantern (March&rsquo;s 
Sciopticon).&rdquo;
<br />
<br />
The total enrollment in the entire University at that time was 228.
Nevertheless, in that same year the College offered lectures on Economic
Botany and Improvement of Varieties in Plants and Animals by Charles E.
Bessey (a visiting Lecturer from Iowa Agricultural College), on Forestry by
Henry N. Bolander, on Field Botany by Walter P. Gibbons and Alexander
Kellogg, and on Lower Forms of Vegetable Life by H. W. Harkness. All
four of the last gentlemen were associated with the California Academy of
Sciences in San Francisco. <br />
<br />
Bessey recalled that he was paid $300 for the month&rsquo;s lectures plus
travel and other expenses, which he thought to be very generous 
recompense. He and Mrs. Bessey were met in Omaha by President Gilman (who
was just returning from an interview that led to his accepting the 
presidency of Johns Hopkins), and they journeyed together to California by
train. Some of Bessey&rsquo;s recollections of his Berkeley experience, as 
described in a letter he wrote in 1911, may be illuminating. 
<blockquote>
Arriving at Oakland we were advised that it would be best for us to find quarters
in town rather than to attempt to do so in Berkeley, then only a much scattered
village of but a few people. A horse car ran towards Berkeley at long intervals, and
a couple of miles out in the country it stopped in a discouraged sort of way, and the
passengers were obligated to wait on an open platform for a smaller car drawn by
a single mule at a very slow pace. In time, however, the car brought one to the edge
of the University grounds, at that time marked by a brook and a fine California
Laurel tree. We crossed the brook on a plank, and walked a little distance to the
two buildings which housed the University of that day. I think it took a full hour to
make the trip from Oakland to Berkeley. How far the distance actually is between
the two places I have never learned, but at that time it seemed to be many miles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <br />
<br />
The first course of lectures was begun on the 14th of January, and continued for
three weeks. While labeled &ldquo;Economic Botany&rdquo; it was actually a pretty fair
presentation of a very considerable portion of the vegetable kingdom after the
modern fashion, running from lower to higher plants.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The treatment was
primarily structural, but to this were added pathological discussions which were
really not bad for that time, when the term &ldquo;plant pathology&rdquo; was as yet scarcely
ever heard in botanical lectures anywhere in the country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The second course of
lectures was devoted to the principles of Plant Breeding, a subject which was then
very new in every part of the United States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This second course was completed
February 16. </blockquote>

A garden of economic plants had been established by 1879. In the
Experiment Station report for that year, Hilgard proposed creation of a
botanical garden for native California plants. Also he pleaded for a
permanent provision for instruction in botany. The President replied,
&ldquo;The importance of providing instruction in Botany is known to the Board
and freely appreciated by it, but want of means makes the appointment of
an instructor at present out of the question.&rdquo; However, Hilgard had gotten
his message across and the President&rsquo;s report for 1884-86 contains the
following: 

<blockquote>
It is important that a separate department of general and economic Botany
should be formed, and that a Professor of Botany should be appointed at a salary of
$3,000 a year. He will require an assistant for the purpose of taking charge of the
herbarium and aiding in instruction of the classes at $600 a year. The formation of
a large herbarium should be seriously begun. The annual expenses will be $200 a
year. The cost of the department of Botany then should be $4,100 per year.</blockquote>

The first strictly botanical appointee in the history of the University of
California and hence the actual founder of the Department, was Edward L.
Greene, appointed Instructor in Botany in 1885. He was a Rhode 
Island-born and Wisconsin-educated Episcopalian clergyman. When he was 
stationed in Yreka in 1872, he was sending plant specimens obtained in his
vigorous field work to Asa Gray at Harvard. A decade later he was
established in Berkeley as Rector of St. Mark&rsquo;s and had made connections
with the California Academy of Sciences. Prior to his appointment he had
taught an occasional course at the University for a stipend of $900 per
annum. <br />
<br />
By 1890 a College of Natural Sciences had been established to provide a
course of study leading to the B.S. degree &ldquo;to meet the wants of students
not caring for the courses in the colleges of applied science.&rdquo; The 
Department of Botany was established under the new College in the same year.
An early start had been made on a botanical garden with the employment
of a student named Ivar Tidestrom; a herbarium had been initiated as a
unit of the Department&rsquo;s activities; and a spring garden of native plants
had been designed by Assistant Willis Linn Jepson. In 1891-92 Professor
Greene taught Systematic, Economic, and Medical Botany (five terms in
all), assisted by Instructor Marshall Avery Howe, who taught Vegetal
Structure and Morphology and Cryptogamic Botany. Joseph Burtt-Davy,
an Englishman, began a ten-year association with the Department the
following year, teaching Economic and Commercial Botany and serving in
the Experiment Station, before going on to a distinguished career in South
Africa and the Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford. <br />
<br />
This founding era ended when Greene resigned in 1895 to become
Professor of Botany at the Catholic University of America. From 1904
until his death in 1915, he was an associate in the Smithsonian Institution. 
(There is speculation that he visualized himself as a likely candidate
to fill the immense gap created in American botany by the death of Asa
Gray.) As was the custom of the day, when he left California, Greene took
his excellent herbarium with him. The Washington plans seem not to
have gone well, and his herbarium went on to Notre Dame, as did he, but
he died soon afterwards. The Greene Herbarium, rich in California types,
is still at Notre Dame where it now has the distinction of being the first
herbarium to be completely computerized. <br />
<br />
Following Greene&rsquo;s departure there was a flurry of worry and intrigue
among the junior staff members, sparked by the efforts of Dean Hilgard
to move Botany back into the College of Agriculture. Departmental
autonomy was assured, however, by the appointment of William Albert
Setchell of Yale and Harvard, then 31 years old, as Professor and 
Chairman, the combined position he held until his retirement in 1934. It was
Setchell, with his pioneering systematic studies of marine algae and his
broad interest in the dynamics of plant evolution and phytogeography,
who established the Herbarium and the Botanical Garden officially, and
who set the Department on its way to achieving international distinction. <br />
<br />
The Department soon had two instructors, when Jepson was promoted
from assistant. W.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Osterhout replaced Howe as the other instructor,
when Howe left for graduate work at Columbia University and a 
successful subsequent career at the New York Botanical Garden. With the staff
thus expanded, it was now possible to offer some sixteen semesters of
botany, with Setchell giving his always popular introductory course as well
as cryptogamic botany; Jepson taught systematic botany; Osterhout, 
physiology, histology, and cytology; and Burtt-Davy, economic botany. 
Setchell, Jepson, and Osterhout collaborated to give a &ldquo;Botanical Seminary,&rdquo;
and each offered advanced work for graduates in his own specialty. <br />
<br />
In 1898 Jepson was awarded the tenth Ph.D. degree to be given by the
University and was promptly promoted to Assistant Professor. His thesis
was entitled &ldquo;Flora of Western Middle California,&rdquo; forerunner of the
famous 1925 <em>Manual of the Flowering Plants of California</em> and the 
incomplete <em>Flora of California</em>. Osterhout received his doctorate the following
year and his assistant professorship in 1901. <br />
<br />
From its founding, the Department of Botany had occupied quarters in
South Hall, one of the two original Berkeley academic buildings. In 1897,
a two-story Botany Building was constructed on the north bank of 
Strawberry Creek for the Department&rsquo;s exclusive use. In 1921 it was moved
across the creek to a site near the present Hertz Hall to make way for the
erection of Stephens Union. <br />
<br />
When Burtt-Davy resigned in 1902, Harvey M. Hall was named 
Instructor in the Department of Botany and Assistant Botanist in the
Experiment Station. Hall took his Ph.D. in 1906, but his final examination
had to be postponed from April to December because of the earthquake.
In addition to carrying on Burtt-Davy&rsquo;s work, Hall was unofficially put in
charge of both the Herbarium, housed after 1907 in the Hearst Mining
Building, and the Botanical Garden, and he made major contributions to
these important facilities of the Department. He added nearly 200,000
specimens to the Herbarium, at least 10 percent of them collected by
himself, and also played a large part in arranging for the magnificent gift
to the Department of the herbarium and library of Mr. and Mrs. 
T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Brandegee. Hall also lobbied successfully for setting aside the present
Strawberry Canyon site as the future location of the Botanical Garden. The
Garden then was located in the glade now partially occupied by the Moffitt
Undergraduate Library. In 1919 he resigned to head the Department of
Plant Biology of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, now at Stanford,
and to preside over the famous transplant studies and what Frans Stafleu,
Dutch botanical historian, likes to refer to as &ldquo;the birth of Biosystematics.&rdquo;
<br />
<br />
Osterhout left in 1909 to accept a position at Harvard and to go on to a
distinguished career in plant physiology at both Harvard and the 
Rockefeller Institute. His departure forced the Department to devise various
makeshifts for teaching plant physiology at Berkeley; later it was also
taught in the College of Agriculture. <br />
<br />
A lecture and laboratory course in general botany was developed in
1912-13 by Assistant Professor Nathaniel L. Gardner, who had taken a
local Ph.D. in 1906 after becoming associated with Setchell in the study of
marine algae, and Thomas Harper Goodspeed, who was appointed 
instructor after concluding undergraduate work at Brown University and
gaining a Berkeley doctorate. However, departments in the College of
Agriculture were not happy with the style of presentation in the new
course, and they established a special one-semester course for their own
students in 1919-20. Satisfaction was restored with the course after Richard 
M. Holman was appointed as assistant professor the next year, and the
special offering was dropped. Holman was a California- and 
German-trained plant physiologist and an experienced teacher. Important 
byproducts of this beginning course were the influential <em>Textbook of 
General Botany</em> by Holman and W.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Robbins and, somewhat later, the
<em>Laboratory Manual</em> by Bonar, Holman, and associate Lucile Roush. So
anxious were publishers to secure a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; text that royalties on the
textbook were bid up to an unprecedented level. Miss Roush deserves
much credit not only for preparation of the manual but also for her
gracious handling of the teaching assistants, who in those days each
manned twelve hours of laboratory per week. <br />
<br />
A course in plant physiology, Botany 7, was instituted in Fall 1922.
Gardner took over the teaching of Setchell&rsquo;s cryptogamic botany and
served as Curator of the Herbarium until 1934. When Elmer D. Merrill
was Dean of Agriculture in 1924-29, his wide contacts in the Pacific Basin
and East Asia enriched the Herbarium by a tremendous influx of 
specimens from these regions. Merrill reputedly spent much of his time
working on these collections and he induced several of his former 
associates from the Manila Bureau of Science, particularly the pteridologist
Edwin B. Copeland, to form more or less lasting associations with the
Herbarium. <br />
<br />
Lee Bonar, trained at the University of Michigan, was appointed 
Instructor for 1922-23, became associated with Holman in teaching plant
physiology and general botany, and developed instruction in various phases
of mycology (especially forest fungi) as this area was gradually 
relinquished by Setchell. The latter, having abundantly demonstrated his 
capacity to teach everything offered by the Department gave up his 
suspiciously popular one-semester lecture course, Fundamentals of Botany,
which had attained an enrollment of approximately 1,000 by 1922 and was
on every football player&rsquo;s program, and contented himself with his two
memorable courses in history of botany and plant distribution, respectively. <br />
<br />
The College of Letters and Science was created as a curricular unit in
1916-17 by the merger of the College of Social Sciences and the College of
Natural Sciences. The Department of Botany was, of course, a founding
department, and one that has subsequently contributed a disproportionate
share of the leadership of the College. <br />
<br />
In the early 1920&rsquo;s laboratory work began to be emphasized in general
courses. This coincided with the loss to the Department of the Chemistry
Annex that had for several years provided space for class laboratories,
storerooms, and research for staff and graduate students. New space now
had to be found and, after various expedients, the Department was able to
take over the Palmer House, a remodeled residence that had been moved
from the site of Memorial Stadium to that now occupied by Cowell
Hospital. It provided laboratories for teaching general botany and forest
fungi and some office and research facilities until the Department moved
to the Life Sciences Building in 1930. <br />
<br />
Herbert L. Mason, who had served as associate from 1925 to 1931,
taking over more or less informally much of the responsibility for 
systematics in view of Jepson&rsquo;s declining health, was appointed instructor in
1931. The following year he married Lucile Roush and also was awarded
the Ph.D. for a study concerned with the paleobotany of conifers. He
assumed control of the Herbarium in 1934 and served as its very able
Director from 1938 to 1963, a period of rapid growth. <br />
<br />
With the retirement of Setchell and Gardner in 1934, the death of
Holman in 1935, and the retirement of Jepson in 1937, an important era
in the history of the Department of Botany came to a close. The 
Setchell-Jepson era had seen the Department achieve national and international
distinction, but the Department was unhappily polarized between these
two strong but very different personalities and their adherents. The
University Administration evidently thought this a propitious time for a
thorough review, and the inevitable confidential committee was appointed
and recommended a fundamental reorganization. In essence, the 
committee advocated (1) an amalgamation with the Division of Plant 
Nutrition of the College of Agriculture, (2) the naming of an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; 
chairman, and (3) active participation in the instructional program by plant
scientists from Agriculture. These moves were interpreted by some as the
final triumph of the College of Agriculture in its effort to win control over
Botany. <br />
<br />
Goodspeed, who might have been expected to be the next chairman,
was consoled with the directorship of the Botanical Garden. Here he built
up an effective research group, which included at one time or another
Priscilla Avery, Muriel Bradley, Mildred C. Thompson, and Helen Mar
Wheeler, among others, devoted to studying the cytology and genetics of
<em>Nicotiana</em>. He also launched the successful Botanical Garden expeditions
to the Andes, from which the Herbarium as well as the Garden profited. <br />
<br />
During this same period, Marion Stilwell Cave was appointed a 
research associate and began her productive studies in embryology and
cytology, which have continued to the present time. Dennis R. Hoagland,
the distinguished student of plant nutrition, served as chairman for two
years, to be replaced by Alva R. Davis. The first appointment under the
new regime was that of Adriance S. Foster, a Cornell- and Bussey 
Institute-trained plant morphologist, who came in 1934. Professors Davis,
Hoagland, Charles B. Lipman, Howard S. Reed, and James P. Bennett, all
from Plant Nutrition, and James T. Barrett from Plant Pathology 
participated in the instructional program, but only Davis became a full-time
member of the Department of Botany and, indeed, served as the principal
architect of its new phase. By 1940 few traces of the amalgamation with
Agriculture were still evident, although Lipman and Reed each continued
to teach a course. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Sailor&rdquo; Davis, who had been a merchant seaman in his youth, was
trained at Washington University and became an early associate of 
Hoagland&rsquo;s group. He was active in the Academic Senate&rsquo;s agencies of 
self-government and demonstrated remarkable coolness and wisdom, 
administrative talents unlikely to be overlooked for long. One of his devices for
welding together a harmonious department was the daily 4 P.M. coffee
hour in the chairman&rsquo;s office, which effectively disposed of any necessary
&ldquo;business&rdquo; and initiated the younger staff members into the complexities
of the University, and which was enhanced by the talents of a 
good-humored and accomplished raconteur. Lincoln Constance, one of Jepson&rsquo;s
last students, was added to the faculty in 1937, and Ralph Emerson, a
Harvard-trained experimental mycologist, in 1940. The three newest
appointees were initially involved heavily in one or another of the 
beginning courses, usually in company with a senior staff member, but they
were also allowed to develop their own special areas of interest and to
attract graduate students. <br />
<br />
After the outbreak of World War II, Davis was recalled to active duty as
commander of an artillery school in southern California, Goodspeed was
sent to South America by the State Department, Constance went to
Washington to work for the Office of Strategic Services, and Emerson first
taught physics and then became an important participant in the Guayule
Project of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Salinas. Bonar became
acting chairman and Reed taught plant physiology to the few students
who remained. Much of the Department&rsquo;s physical space was taken over
by war-related statistical activities. The sole staff addition was Assistant
Professor George F. Papenfuss, a Johns Hopkins- and Swedish-trained
South African, who vigorously reactivated teaching and research in
phycology. <br />
<br />
The staff members who had been on war leave returned during 1945,
and there was extensive reorganization of course offerings, marked by
increasing emancipation from the role of service department to 
Agriculture. The rapidly expanding enrollments that now affected the entire
University made possible several new appointments. Leonard Machlis,
who had taken his degree with Hoagland&rsquo;s group, Johannes Proskauer,
with a University of London doctorate, and John G. Torrey, a Harvard
Ph.D., all joined the Department between 1946 and 1949. Old research
fields were rejuvenated and active new ones were developed as the wave of
student applicants rose even higher. <br />
<br />
Davis was appointed the first budgetary dean of the College of Letters
and Science by President Sproul in 1947, and the Department 
unhesitatingly turned to Bonar to serve as chairman, which he did for the next
seven years. One of the earliest problems to confront Bonar was the
disposition of the Jepson Herbarium and Library, which had been willed
to the University with stipulations. Although Jepson died in 1946, his
estate was not settled until 1949. A year later Rimo Bacigalupi, a graduate
of Stanford and a Harvard Ph.D., was named Curator to preside over the
Jepson collection. &ldquo;Bach&rdquo; brought in Lawrence R. Heckard, a graduate of
the Department and then teaching at Urbana, to assist him in 1960. At the
same time Papenfuss recalled his former student, Paul C. Silva, who was
also teaching at the University of Illinois, to become his assistant in the
Herbarium. The Department voted in 1967 to put the key Herbarium
positions in the professional research botanist series, a classification that
was accorded to Silva and Heckard, and later to John Strother and Alan R.
Smith, when they were appointed. Heckard succeeded Bacigalupi as
Curator of the Jepson Herbarium and Library upon the latter&rsquo;s retirement
in 1968. <br />
<br />
Constance followed in Davis&rsquo; footsteps as chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee. He had acquired Goodspeed&rsquo;s interest in Latin
America and returned from a Chilean sabbatical to serve as chairman of
the Department for the single year 1954-55. His most notable 
achievement was to assure that the Botanical Garden, which was about to be set
adrift by Goodspeed&rsquo;s impending retirement, revert to the Department.
At about the same time, Emerson created a &ldquo;Microgarden&rdquo; for &ldquo;lower
plants,&rdquo; which was subsequently assiduously cared for by Robert Berman. <br />
<br />
With the explosive increase in enrollment in the late 1940&rsquo;s and early
1950&rsquo;s, the whole character of the University of California underwent
rapid and profound changes. Earlier in the century capacity had been
increased quickly by converting existing teacher-training institutions into
branches of the University, beginning with the Los Angeles Normal
School in 1919, which ten years later had become a full campus as UCLA.
Santa Barbara joined the University family by the same route in 1944, but
shortly thereafter legislative action put an end to such conversions. What
had before World War II been to most Berkeleyans a single-campus (i.e.,
Berkeley) institution with a Southern Branch at Los Angeles and a few
outlying establishments&mdash;Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla,
Citrus Experiment Station at Riverside, Lick Observatory, the San 
Francisco Medical Center, and the Davis &ldquo;farm&rdquo;&mdash;was now suddenly rocketed
to &ldquo;multiversity&rdquo; status as several of these locations acquired full campus
status. Clark Kerr took office as the first Chancellor of the Berkeley
Campus in 1952. When Davis retired three years later, he became for one
year the first Berkeley Vice Chancellor, and Constance was named to
succeed him as Dean of Letters and Science. Davis had transformed the
College into a significant budgetary unit, embracing more than half the
campus. One of his final acts as Dean was to ask that a faculty committee
undertake the task of defining the objectives of the College and 
re-examining its programs and requirements with regard to these objectives.
Armed with a series of explicit directives, which Emerson had played a
major role in preparing, Constance as the new Dean was able to carry out
a series of sweeping academic reforms in his seven-year tenure. In 
1957-58, Emerson and Richard Eakin of Zoology initiated the interdepartmental 
elementary course, Biology 11, forerunner of many successful joint
efforts in the field of biology. <br />
<br />
At the departmental level, Foster (with initial assistance from Bonar)
took over the chairmanship and served for five and one-half busy years. In
1958-57 Herbert G. Baker, a University of Leeds-trained &ldquo;genecologist&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;evolutionary ecologist,&rdquo; as he later preferred to be called so as not to
be mistaken for a gynecologist), gave up a chair in newly liberated Ghana
to assume directorship of the Botanical Garden. Under the day-to-day
management of Anton Christ, the Garden had played an increasingly
important role as provider of research and class materials. Since 
Goodspeed had covered plant cytology as well as the Garden, the Department
was allowed to add to its roster William A. Jensen, the first University of
Chicago-trained staff member. His expressed enthusiasm for 
undergraduate teaching was a strong factor in his selection. Torrey returned
permanently to Harvard in 1960. Philip J. Snider, also Harvard-trained,
came to share the burgeoning load in mycology, but left again in 1963.
Robert E. Cleland, a biochemist from Cal Tech, took over Torrey&rsquo;s
teaching for a few years, but in 1964 accepted an appointment at the
University of Washington. <br />
<br />
During the first half of the 1960&rsquo;s, under Machlis&rsquo; chairmanship, the
Department enjoyed its greatest flush of growth. The new chairman
exhibited an unparalleled ability to obtain the appointment and rapid
promotion of able faculty members and to secure internal and external
funds for rehabilitation of laboratories and other facilities that badly
needed renovation after several decades of use. A well-organized and
well-staffed storeroom, supervised by Robert Marsicano, was another of
his successes. He also brought in Marge Eurich as departmental secretary.
Machlis gave leadership to the Biology Council, most successful of the
several area councils established at about that time to cope with matters of
interdepartmental concern. The Council launched Biology 1 in 1963. Both
the Sagehen Creek Field Station in the Sierra Nevada and the Bodega
Marine Laboratory, the latter owing much to Papenfuss&rsquo; and Emerson&rsquo;s
unremitting efforts, were brought into the orbit of the Department&rsquo;s
instructional program. <br />
<br />
A Chancellor&rsquo;s committee charged with locating promising potential
staff members in the area of molecular biology produced the name of
Roderic B. Park, a graduate of Harvard and Cal Tech. With three
departments bidding for him, the Department of Botany was immensely
gratified that he chose to associate himself with it. Between 1963 and
1966, six additional faculty members were appointed. Daniel Branton, a
specialist on cell membranes, Robert Ornduff, a biosystematist, and
Melvin S. Fuller, a mycologist, had all done their doctoral work at Berkeley
but had had significant teaching or post-doctoral experience at other
institutions. Watson &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; Laetsch, Stanford-trained, and Russell L.
Jones, from Aberystwyth and Michigan State, shared an interest in growth
and development. John A. West, whose interests fitted particularly well
with the availability of the Bodega station, had obtained his training in
marine phycology at the University of Washington from one of 
Papenfuss&rsquo; former students. <br />
<br />
The mid-1960&rsquo;s were not only a time of rapid growth, but also one of
increasing student and faculty disaffection, culminating in the so-called
Free Speech Movement. Constance, who served as Vice-Chancellor at
Berkeley from 1962 to 1965, was happy to return, somewhat 
battle-scarred, to being &ldquo;just a professor&rdquo; and Director of the Herbarium. The
staff of the latter boasted many extraordinarily devoted persons over the
years (Harriet Walker, Ethel Crum, Floy Bracelin, Vera Miller, Helen
Sharsmith, Isabelle Tavares), but none who so strongly left her own cachet
of friendly hospitality as Annetta Carter, who assisted Constance as she
had Mason for many years, but voluntarily retired in 1968 to devote
herself to the study of her Baja California collections. Alice Q. Howard
stepped in to rescue the management from potential disaster. In the
Department, Emerson, who was acting head during the disorders of 
1964-65, survived to serve as chairman in his own right from 1967 to 1971.
Although departmental glass doors and windows were smashed with
sickening regularity, the Department suffered no internal violence and
little internal division. This can perhaps be explained by the fact that staff
members took their teaching duties seriously, or simply that there was a
small number of botany students. <br />
<br />
As a consequence of these happenings of the mid-1960&rsquo;s, graduate
students were encouraged to organize themselves and to supply 
representatives to participate in faculty meetings. This development was greeted at
first with apprehension by some faculty, but it soon proved to be not at all
horrendous but actually quite constructive. <br />
<br />
The departmental faculty, particularly the more senior ones, had begun
to reap a gratifying crop of kudos: election to office in national 
professional societies, membership in learned academies, Guggenheim and
Miller fellowships, and awards of various kinds. Emerson, in 1971, became
the first member of the Department since Setchell (not counting 
Hoagland) to be taken into the National Academy of Sciences. It was at about
this time that the Department received the heartening word that Cartter&rsquo;s
survey (1966) of graduate departments for the American Council on
Education had ranked it the leading botany department in the nation, with
Harvard placed second. The fact that Harvard had no botany department
did little to dampen the euphoria. This accolade was reinforced by another
number one rating by Roose and Andersen&rsquo;s survey in 1970, also for the
Council. Perhaps it was even more important that the younger members
of the staff, especially, demonstrated a great ability to attract sizable
research grants. <br />
<br />
Much to the dismay of most members of the Department, the 
University changed from the semester system to a quarter system in 1966,
necessitating reorganization of courses, straining availability of laboratory
materials, and forcing other painful adjustments. It did permit 
introduction of an integrated biology course&mdash;Biology 1A-B-C&mdash;which had
long been an objective of the Biology Council, and in which Botany staff
became heavily involved. Two years later an ecology course, Biology 150,
was added. <br />
<br />
When Fuller left in 1968 to head the Botany Department of the
University of Georgia, O&rsquo;Neil Ray Collins, a student of slime molds,
trained at the University of Iowa, became the first black faculty member in
the Department. Baker, tired of directing the Botanical Garden after more
than a decade, and Laetsch, who replaced him, both very significantly
expanded the Garden&rsquo;s instructional role. Donald R. Kaplan was enticed
back from the Irvine campus to replace his major professor, Foster, who
retired in 1970. Kaplan immediately set about putting his own distinctive
stamp on plant morphology, which Foster had taught meticulously for
many years as Botany 16 in the fall and Botany 105 in the spring. With
Proskauer&rsquo;s tragic early death in 1970, the Department sought to shore up
its strength in the area of structural botany by appointing Rudolf Schmid,
who had obtained his doctorate at the University of Michigan.
<br />
<br />
Toward the beginning of the 1970&rsquo;s, the vocal but mercurial student
movement suddenly discovered The Ecology and The Environment.
Whatever was meant by these terms, the Department was overwhelmed
by young people passionately interested in drug plants, edible native
plants, organically grown vegetables, biological symbiosis, and the like.
Much of this tide of increased enrollment affected Baker most directly, but
it also had a spectacular effect on the California flora course, taught
alternately by Ornduff and Constance. <br />
<br />
Jensen succeeded Emerson as chairman in 1971. Soon he could point to
the retirement of Papenfuss in 1971 and the defection of Branton to
Harvard in 1973 as strong argument for providing the Department with
more <em>manpower</em>, which was particularly needed in the area of plant
ecology. However, an always unpredictable Department instead selected
as an ecologist Nancy Vivrette, who was trained at the Santa Barbara
campus, as the first woman to become a regular faculty member in the 
83-year history of the Department. <br />
<br />
In 1972, history seemed to repeat itself, when Park was appointed
Provost and Dean of the College of Letters and Science. His situation
differed from that which had once faced Davis and Constance in that he
had the assistance of four divisional deans and that he also had 
responsibility for the Ethnic Studies programs that were a specific result of the
Third World Strike of a few years earlier. Collins was quickly &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;
by the Dean of the Graduate Division to serve as his associate dean in the
area of minority programs and problems. Ornduff took over directorship
of the Botanical Garden from Laetsch, who found that responsibility for
the Lawrence Hall of Science, a University-sponsored facility to promote
public education in science, was sufficiently time-consuming. Attracted by
the opportunity to serve as Program Director for Developmental Biology
for the National Science Foundation, Jensen departed for Washington in
August 1973, leaving Machlis as acting chairman to work his old magic in
a drastically changed budgetary climate. When Jensen took up the 
challenging invitation to return to the campus as chairman of the Department
of Instruction in Biology (DIB) for 1974-75, Machlis was confirmed in a
new administrative tour of duty at the departmental level. The recycled
chairman foresaw his most pressing task to be that of reorganizing the
Department&rsquo;s supporting staff and placing the reins of management in
the hands of a capable (if not super-human) laboratory business officer;
the latter objective was achieved in the appointment of Mitsuru &ldquo;Mitch&rdquo;
Ikuta. <br />
<br />
A long and careful search for a cell physiologist to replace Branton
culminated in 1975 with the appointment of W. Zacheus &ldquo;Zac&rdquo; Cande,
who capped a Stanford Ph.D. with two-and-a-half years at Boulder,
harassing and manipulating the otherwise smoothly proceeding process
of cell division. The year of 1975-76 was expected to see the retirement of
both Constance (mandatory) and Machlis (voluntary, for reasons of
health), who had been associated in one way or another for four decades,
with the hope that both would be replaced by young scholars eager to
extend the high reputation of the Department into the final quarter of the
twentieth century, and well past its centennial year of 1985!<br />
<br />
</span><span align="center" class="pageSubheading">Epilogue </span><span class="bodyText"><br />
<br />
Departmental affairs, like human ones, rarely work out exactly as
anticipated. Machlis died suddenly and tragically in April 1976. Collins
replaced him first as acting and then as regularly appointed chairman.
Emerson was chosen as one of the two Faculty Research Lecturers for
1976-77, and made his usual excellent presentation. Thomas Duncan,
upon completing his doctorate at Ann Arbor, joined the Department in
1976, bringing an interest in the systematics of buttercups and the capacity
to study them by the application of computers. Bonar died in the summer
of 1977, at the ripe age of eighty-five. With Ornduff on subbatical leave,
Constance looked after the two herbaria and the Botanical Garden for the
academic year 1977-78. Jensen was chosen president of the Botanical
Society of America for 1978, the fourth member [after Foster (1954),
Emerson (1967), and Constance (1970)] of the Department to hold that
office. [Added in proofs, June 1978: Herbert Baker has just been elected to
head the Botanical Society of America!] Lewis Feldman, a native of 
Hayward only thinly disguised as a student of Torrey&rsquo;s at Harvard and for the
past two years a Miller Fellow, joined the Department on July 1, 1978, as
plant physiologist, thus successfully ending a long search. <br />
<br />
As Ed Feder, Associate Dean of Letters and Science, is reported to have
remarked, &ldquo;The first thing to know about the Botany Department is that
it&rsquo;s the best in the country, and it damned well intends to stay that way!&rdquo;

<span class="bodyText">*During the 1950&rsquo;s the Ph.D. in Botany was administered by a Graduate Group that
included representatives of Plant Sciences (College of Agriculture) on both the Davis and
Berkeley campuses and Forestry at Berkeley as well as the Berkeley Department of Botany
staff. Some individuals included on this list were actually housed in other departments; those
who did their work at Davis are intentionally excluded. Some graduate students who worked
in the Department at Berkeley took their degrees in other Groups (e.g., Genetics, 
Microbiology. Plant Physiology); these are included insofar as possible. The assistance of Professor
Louis Jacobson, Professor of Plant Physiology in the Department of Soils and Plant
Nutrition, is gratefully acknowledged.<br /><br /></span>
