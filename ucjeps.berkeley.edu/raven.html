Peter H. Raven,</a> a native Californian with a lifelong interest in 
natural history, has built on his science to achieve international 
prominence in the fields of botany and conservation.  His career was 
launched when, as a 14-year-old boy wandering the wilds of San Francisco, 
he discovered an overlooked shrub growing in the Presidio, subsequently 
named the Raven's Manzanita <I>(Arctostaphylos hookeri </I>subsp. 
<I>ravenii), </I>which exists in the wild as a single remaining plant.  
As Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, Home Secretary of the 
National Academy of Sciences, and member of the President's Committee of 
Advisors on Science and Technology, Dr. Raven has retained his seminal 
appreciation for the Bay Area's richly unique natural heritage while 
simultaneously developing a deep understanding of the global significance 
of local efforts to protect this heritage.
<P>
Dr. Raven will share his insights at a special "Earth Day Eve" talk, 
which will form the centerpiece of a Stewardship Fair on the evening of 
Tuesday, April 21.  Here you will also find available a treasure trove of 
information on existing site stewardship projects in the San Francisco 
Bay Area, ranging from community grass-roots efforts <a 
href="http://www.imaja.com/change/environment/albanyca/albanyca.html">  
(e.g. Albany Hill) </a> to the ambitious site stewardship program of the 
Golden Gate National Park/ Golden Gate National Recreation Area, with 
numerous opportunities for hands-on participation on the following Earth 
Day weekend.   You will also find information, ideas, and resources to 
assist in the development of new community site stewardship projects.
<P>
Community site stewardship projects have developed over the last
several years as an ideal way to "think globally, act locally", to foster 
the sense of place that is an essential component of any sustainable
relationship with the planet we call home.  While not diminishing the
heart-wrenching need to halt the further destruction of biodiversity in
tropical and temperate rainforests, we are called also to appreciate and 
foster that component of our global natural heritage that comprises our 
community back yards.  The San Francisco Bay Area is in fact a global 
"hot spot" of natural diversity, resulting from the complex interplay of 
geology and microclimates, which has been reduced in many places to a 
series of "islands in an urban sea".  A multitude of threats continues 
even when the "islands" are set aside as parks, primarily in the form of 
invasive pest plants which, if left unchecked, overwhelm and displace the 
indigenous diversity.
<P>
Not only do community site stewardship projects give us an
opportunity to make a difference, but to express our personal
responsibility in a way that bridges the human and natural communities.  
*And this opportunity is accessible to everyone, independent of ethnic, 
economic, or educational background. * To quote Gary Snyder <I>(The 
Discovery of Turtle Island), </I>"We are all indigenous to this planet, 
this mosaic of wild gardens we are being called by nature and history to 
reinhabit in good spirit.  Part of that responsibility is to choose a 
place.  To restore the land one must live and work in a place.  To work 
in a place is to work with others.  People who work together in a place 
become a community, and a community, in time, grows a culture.  To work 
on behalf of the wild is to restore culture."

<P>
Peter H. Raven, a native Californian with a lifelong interest in natural
history, has built on his science to achieve international prominence in
the fields of botany and conservation.  His career was launched through 
an undergraduate degree at the University of California at Berkeley 
(A.B., 1957) and graduate studies at the University of California, Los 
Angeles (Ph.D. 1960).
<P>
Following nine years as a member of the Department of Biological
Sciences at Stanford University, Dr. Raven came to St. Louis in 1971 as
Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and Engelmann Professor of
Botany at Washington University.  During more than a quarter of a century 
in these posts, Dr. Raven has led the revitalization of the research, 
educational, and display programs of the Missouri Botanical Garden.  The 
research programs of the Garden now range throughout the world, with 
particular concentration on Latin America and Africa, as well as 
important programs in North America, China, and other parts of the world.

<P>
In addition to his activities in St. Louis, Dr. Raven has served for the 
past decade as Home Secretary of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, 
the most prestigious body of scientists in the United States, and is very 
actively involved with the activities of the Academy and its operating 
arm, the National Research Council.  He also is a member of President 
Clinton's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, and is a long 
time member of the National Geographic Society's Committee for Research 
and Exploration.  Dr. Raven served as the first Chair of the U.S. 
Civilian Research and Development Foundation, a government-established 
organization that funds joint research with the independent countries of 
the former Soviet Union.  He is active internationally in science, 
science policy, and particularly conservation, where he has emphasized 
the need for a transition to global sustainability in forums held 
throughout the world.  As a result of his work, Dr. Raven is the 
recipient of numerous prizes and awards, including the prestigious 
Environment Prize of the Institut de la Vie; Volvo Prize; Tyler Prize and 
Sasakawa Environment Prize.  He has also held Guggenheim and John D. and 
Catharine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowships.
<P>
Dr. Raven's personal scientific activities now focus mainly on his co 
editorship of the Flora of China, a joint Chinese-American international 
project that is leading to a contemporary account of all the plants of 
China &#139; which, with about 30,000 species, constitute about an eighth 
of the total found in the world.
<P>
Dr. Raven is the author of numerous books and publications, both popular 
and scientific, including his co-authorship of the internationally best 
selling textbook in botany, The Biology of Plants, (Worth Publishers, 
Inc., New York), now in its fifth edition, and a leading textbook in the 
environment, Environment (Saunders College Publishing, Pennsylvania).
