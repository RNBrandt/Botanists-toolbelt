  <p class="workshopBody">This course will be an introduction to the flora of the San Francisco Bay region and the techniques used to identify plants of California. It is designed for those unfamiliar with plant identification keys who are ready to jump into botanical detective work. Emphasis will be on the recognition and keying of plant families encountered in the field. With a working knowledge of common plant families, and comfort in using plant keys, identification is an enjoyable challenge. This is also a great way to appreciate plants and take the time to look at them closely.

  <p class="workshopBody">California is a cornucopia of plants; many of the plants belong to a few groups that have diversified throughout the world. By learning to identify these larger groupings of plants, we will be prepared to recognize plants wherever we go.</p> 
 
				<p class="workshopBody">This course will be an introduction to the flora of the San Francisco Bay region, with an emphasis on identifying plants to the family level. A key component of this workshop will be the use of dichotomous keys to identify unknown plants, largely through the use of the family key in The Jepson Manual. We will learn some of the obvious attributes that define the common plant families and larger lineages by looking closely at plants to appreciate their uniqueness and the characters that will lead us toward a correct classification. Although this course will involve no collecting of plants, we will discuss the nature, use, and importance of herbarium collections. There will also be an introduction to reference books and web resources valuable for the identification of plants in California. This short course will emphasize some of the recent changes in plant classification and explain why such changes are taking place.</p>

  <p class="workshopBody">You are in the field and want to know what family a plant is in: what information do you need? In this intensive plant identification class we will create a framework for learning plants by comparing traits of more than 50 flowering plant families, and learning how to key using <em>The Jepson Manual</em>. Photo-lectures alternate with intensive lab sessions where students learn Vorobik's "divide and conquer" system of understanding groupings of related plant families. Throughout the sessions, botanical terms will be defined and illustrated, and family traits will be outlined, with discussion of revised classification used in <em>The Jepson Manual</em>.</p>

    <span class="workshopLocation">San Clemente Island</span> </p> 
  <p class="workshopBody"> 
San Clemente Island is an active Navy base and is generally not open to the public. With an area of 56 square miles, it is the southernmost of the eight California Channel Islands. Feral goats and pigs have been removed from the island and the vegetation has made a remarkable recovery. There are a number of endemic plants and animals living on the island, including island foxes, island night lizards, and the San Clemente loggerhead shrike.
This six-day workshop will focus on the field identification of the island's flora, with an emphasis on insular endemics. At least 15 amazing plant taxa are known only from San Clemente, including
<em>Astragalus nevinii</em>,
<em>Brodiaea kinkiensis</em>,
<em>Camissonia guadalupensis</em> subsp.  <em>clementina</em>,
<em>Castilleja grisea</em>,
two subsp. of <em>Delphinium variegatum</em>,
<em>Dudleya virens</em> subsp.  <em>virens</em>,
<em>Eriogonum giganteum</em> var. <em>formosum</em>,
<em>Galium catalinense</em> subsp.  <em>acrispum</em>,
<em>Lithophragma maximum</em>,
two <em>Lotus</em> 
(sensu lato) taxa,
<em>Malacothamnus clementinus</em>,
<em>Munzothamnus blairii</em>, and
<em>Triteleia clementina</em>.
</p> 
  <p class="workshopBody"> 
In addition, there are other insular endemic plant taxa that are shared with one or more of the neighboring islands. We will have four full days of botanizing on the island. There will be opportunities to explore beautiful sea coves and rugged coastlines, and to visit many of island's remote corners. Participants will assist the Navy's restoration efforts by mapping rare plant locations and removing nonnative species. Field trips will include moderate hikes of up to three miles over uneven terrain. Hazards may exist due to unexploded ordnance, dense cactus, loose rocky soils, and steep canyons and escarpments.</p> 
  <p class="workshopBody"> 
Workshop fee ($695 for Friends of the Jepson Herbarium, $745 general public) includes airfare to San Clemente Island from North Island Naval Complex in Coronado, hotel-like accommodations in double-occupancy rooms, transportation while on San Clemente, and meals from Friday lunch through Tuesday breakfast.</p>

  <p class="workshopBody">The names of plants have been in flux for centuries, but in recent years, name changes have occurred at an accelerated pace, due largely to advances in our understanding of evolutionary relationships based on analyses of molecular data using modern phylogenetic methods. The results are sometimes striking. For example, in the forthcoming Jepson Manual, some botanists may be surprised to find <em>Mimulus</em> listed under Phrymaceae and <em>Collinsia</em> and <em>Penstemon</em> under Plantaginaceae, rather than the familiar classification of all three genera in Scrophulariaceae. A major goal of this workshop will be to demonstrate that, while such changes may seem inconvenient in the short term, they serve everyone's best interests in the long term. We'll start by reviewing basic concepts and methods of phylogenetic systematics and principles of taxonomy. We'll then explore how new insights into phylogenetic relationships lead to changes in taxonomy. The second half of the workshop will involve presentation and discussion of specific examples of such changes from the California flora, primarily at the family and genus levels, that are being incorporated in <em>The Jepson Manual</em>.</p>

  <p class="workshopBody">This short course in biological soil crusts will emphasize the biodiversity as well as the basic structural and functional attributes of arid land soil crust communities. We will also examine components of the desert lichen community that are not part of the soil crust community. Classroom instruction will include information about the biological components of soil crusts, their ecological roles, the nature and dynamics of their interactions with vascular plant communities, the ecological consequences of damaging soil crust communities, and their potential for reclamation. In the laboratory, we will discuss and practice identifying some of the more prominent members of the soil crust community as well as a variety of lichens from other local substrates. Participants will receive handouts and references. During the workshop, we will take field trips to investigate local soil crust communities and saxicolous lichen communities in several locations in the eastern Mojave Desert. Participants in the class may drive up to 30 miles to the field trip sites and may hike several miles. Limited transportation may be available during the workshop.

    <span class="workshopLocation">UC Berkeley and field sites in the Bay Area</span> </p> 
 
  <p class="workshopBody">Wetlands are typically recognized as soggy portions of the landscape that are covered--often intermittently--with shallow water or have soils saturated with water with plants that look different from the surrounding areas. Scientific studies have shown that wetlands are essential to maintaining the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of the aquatic ecosystem. Resulting state and federal programs have been established that regulate impacts to wetlands as part of their overall water quality protection strategy. But, these agencies differ in how wetlands are defined and geographically delineated.</p> 
 
			<p class="workshopBody">This course will emphasize the wetland definitions and delineation methods used by state and federal agencies in California, including the California Coastal Commission (CCC), State Water Quality Control Board and its Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB), California Department of Fish &amp; Game (CDFG), U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The course will also provide a comparative overview of the definitions and methods used by these agencies together with the latest changes in methodology and approaches for determining jurisdictional boundaries. The course offers useful information and practical hands-on experience for private consultants, agency personnel, attorneys, academics, and the general public who are involved with resource protection, impact assessment, environmental restoration, and/or seeking project authorization from the CCC, RWQCB, CDFG, or Corps.</p> 
                <p class="workshopBody">We will meet on the UC Berkeley campus Friday morning and early afternoon for classroom lectures, then spend the rest of Friday afternoon on campus and nearby exploring how and why using the various definitions and associated methodologies produce different results in terms of wetland area delineated. We will spend Saturday and much of Sunday in the field gaining further experience with definitions and associated terminology through hands-on experience using the various wetland delineation methodologies, with analysis of results and field delineation of wetland-upland boundaries. Participants in the class may drive up to 75 miles per day to the field sites and hike up to three miles each day over wet, uneven terrain.</p>

    <span class="workshopLocation">Various sites in San Diego County</span> </p> 
 
  <p class="workshopBody">San Diego County has the greatest known floristic diversity of any county in the continental United States. A major reason for this is the corresponding high diversity of habitats. Within the South Coast subregion of the California Floristic Province, coastal strand, estuary, inland sage scrub, chaparral, riparian woodland, oak woodland, vernal pool, and grassland habitats are among the major community assemblages. The Peninsular Ranges, including the Palomar, Cuyamaca, and Laguna mountains, contain a number of these communities as well as extensive woodlands and coniferous forests, montane chaparral, and scattered sagebrush scrub. The Colorado Desert, a sub-component of the Sonoran, includes desert succulent scrub, desert wash, alkaline sink, blackbush, and pinyon-juniper communities.</p> 
                <p class="workshopBody">This workshop explores these major habitats and their component plants occurring in our rich county. A slide show orientation on Thursday evening will review these habitats, communities, and vegetation regions and introduce many of the common (and a few rare) plant species that comprise them. Friday will be spent traveling to chaparral, inland sage scrub, grassland, and Torrey pine communities of Mission Trails Regional Park and Torrey Pines State Park, to local estuary and coastal strand/dune communities, and (if the rain pattern permits) to vernal pool communities. On Saturday, we will head to the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, making several stops to observe interesting plants of several community types, followed by optional camping in the desert. Sunday morning will take us to higher elevation pinyon-juniper woodland, followed by montane chaparral and woodlands of the Laguna and Cuyamaca Mountains, returning to San Diego by mid-afternoon. Participants should be prepared for up to 100 miles of driving and several miles of easy to moderate hiking over uneven terrain in potentially hot areas each day. Limited transportation may be available during the workshop. Please contact the herbarium for more information</p>

  <p class="workshopBody">The Santa Cruz Sandhills represent one of California's most remarkable examples of edaphic (soil-related) endemism. Amidst the coast redwood forests that dominate the Santa Cruz Mountains, islands of droughty, nutrient-poor sand soils formed from uplifted Miocene (15 mya) marine sand deposits of the Santa Margarita formation give rise to unique plant communities found nowhere else in the world. They include maritime chaparral dominated by the local endemic Bonny Doon manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos silvicola</em>), and Sand Parkland, which features sparse stands of ponderosa pine (<em>Pinus ponderosa</em>) with a diverse and beautiful herbaceous understory featuring many rare and locally unique plants including three endemic forbs: Ben Lomond buckwheat (<em>Eriogonum nudum</em> var. <em>decurrens</em>), Ben Lomond spineflower (<em>Chorizanthe pungens</em> var. <em>hartwegiana</em>), and Santa Cruz wallflower (<em>Erysimum teretifolium</em>). Floristic jewels, the Sandhills are threatened by sand mining, residential development, incompatible recreation, and the invasion and spread of non-native species.</p> 
            <p class="workshopBody">In this course, participants will learn about the diversity and fascinating ecology of the Sandhills flora. Following an overview lecture Friday evening, participants will hike all day Saturday and half day on Sunday through some of the most outstanding remaining Sandhills communities to experience their uniqueness and diversity first hand. Participants in the class may drive up to 15 miles per day to the field sites and will hike one to three miles per day in sandy soil during potentially warm or rainy weather. Limited transportation may be available during the workshop. Please contact the herbarium for more information.

  <p class="workshopBody">Prominent in plant communities throughout California, the grass family (Poaceae) is the state's second most diverse plant family (after Asteraceae). A species-rich assemblage, its members include cool-season and warm-season species, annuals and perennials, natives and exotics, and widespread dominants and rare endemics. A better understanding of this ubiquitous and diverse family can be gained through this workshop. Participants will be instructed in detail on the vegetative and reproductive features of grasses. Aspects of anatomy, physiology, ecology, and ethnobotany will also be addressed. Most time will be spent learning to use the identification keys in <em>The Jepson Manual</em>. Special attention will be given to difficult couplets and taxa. In addition, participants will learn how to determine major tribes and common genera by use of diagnostic characteristics.</p>

    <span class="workshopLocation">Sierra Nevada Research Institute Yosemite Field Station in Wawona</span> </p> 
 
  <p class="workshopBody"><em>Mimulus</em> is not only an ecologically and evolutionarily interesting genus, it is also showy and beautiful. California is the center of <em>Mimulus</em> diversity: 80 of the world's 120 species occur in the state. <em>Mimulus</em> diversity is especially rich in the Central and Southern Sierra Nevada, where more than 45 species and forms of monkey flower occur. Members of the genus exhibit specific adaptations, patterns of endemism, and geographic distributions that reflect some of the great themes of California botany such as: response to fire, soil endemism, extreme rarity, occurrence in vernal pools, specialized pollination syndromes, hybridization among taxa, and large morphological variability within species</p> 
<p class="workshopBody">This class will focus on the central Sierra Nevada taxa but will also cover <em>Mimulus</em> throughout the state. We will discuss <em>Mimulus</em> evolution, ecology, and conservation while visiting some beautiful monkey flower hotspots in the Yosemite region. We will use <em>The Jepson Manual</em> key and review the relevant morphology needed in the key.</p> 
<p class="workshopBody">A draft of the text and pictures from an upcoming book on California <em>Mimulus</em> will be distributed to class participants. Participants in the class may drive up to 60 miles to the field trip sites and may hike several miles. Limited transportation may be available during the workshop.

    <span class="workshopLocation">UC Berkeley</span> </p> 
 
  <p class="workshopBody"> The recent shift to image presentation by electronic means has created a demand for high-quality plant photographs. If collected in an appropriate manner, sets of standardized photographs can supplement herbarium collections by fulfilling some of the same roles. Unlike single images, sets of standardized images can adequately represent the gross morphology of a plant. The set of images allows the species to be identified, serves as a record the plant's occurrence, and facilitates the creation of new types of keys and learning tools.</p> 
 
			<p class="workshopBody">Workshop participants will learn how to take standardized photographs, and will receive an introduction to some of the amazing things that can be done with standardized images. We will look at three applications of image sets: their use in visual keys, the creation of e-learning programs, and the visual description of characters. The workshop will involve a photography assignment on the Berkeley campus. Participants should have a (free) Google account and know how to upload and share photos through Picasa Web Albums. If time allows, we will cover geotagging, both with and without a GPS photo-tracker.</p>

  <p class="workshopBody">The Asteraceae (or Compositae) is the largest family of dicots and the largest family in California, comprising almost 13 percent of the state's flora. Members of the family occur from polar regions to the tropics, from sea level to the tops of high mountains, and in an extraordinary diversity of habitats ranging from extremely arid deserts to aquatic environments.</p> 
 
			<p class="workshopBody">The Asteraceae have a reputation as a "difficult" family. In part, this comes from the size of the family and the superficial resemblance many Asteraceae have for each other. In addition, the beginner must learn a set of unfamiliar terms that describe some unfamiliar features of the flowers, fruits, and inflorescences. The reputation is not deserved. Once you get past the terminology hurdle, you should be able to key members of the Asteraceae with no greater difficulty than any other family.</p> 
            <p class="workshopBody">This weekend workshop will include overviews of characters used in circumscription, classification, and identification of Asteraceae and the terms used in reference to those characters. Fresh plants will be used to illustrate the family's unity and diversity. An overview of Asteraceae classification and some recent advances in Asteraceae systematics will be included. Participants will learn about changes in Asteraceae taxonomy in <em>The Jepson Manual</em> and will try out the new key to genera on a variety of native and weedy species. Instruction will include one or more local field trips to develop skills in field identification of genera and species. Participants in the class may drive up to 40 miles to the field trip sites and may hike several miles. Limited transportation may be available during the workshop.

    <span class="workshopLocation">Mahogany Flat Campground, Death Valley National Park</span> </p> 
 
  <p class="workshopBody">The Panamint Mountains represent a significant north-south trending geologic feature dividing Death Valley from Panamint Valley. At 11,049 feet elevation, Telescope Peak represents the highest point in the Panamint Mountains and Death Valley National Park. Less than 20 miles away from Telescope Peak is Badwater: at 282 feet below sea level, it is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere. With this kind of difference in elevation, the plant communities in the Panamint Mountains are uniquely diverse and range from creosote bush scrub on the lowest slopes to bristlecone pines on the highest peaks.</p> 
            <p class="workshopBody">The trail to the top of Telescope Peak is one of only two constructed backcountry trails in all of Death Valley National Park. This lofty stretch of the Panamint Mountains catches and holds a lot of snow during winter, but the peak can sometimes be climbed without difficulty as early as mid-March with only a mile or so of deep ridgeline snow.</p> 
                
<p class="workshopBody">This workshop will introduce participants to the geology and rare flora of the region while exploring the Panamint Mountains. One day will be spent learning about the region's unique flora and landscapes from the Telescope Peak Trail. Emphasis will be given to the Panamint's several endemic and rare taxa. Participants will have an opportunity to explore the following plant communities: desert mountain springs, black brush (<em>Coleogyne ramosissima</em>), sagebrush (<em>Artemisia</em> spp.), pinyon/juniper (<em>Pinus monophylla</em>/<em>Juniperus osteosperma</em>), limber pine (<em>Pinus flexilis</em>), and bristlecone pine (<em>Pinus longaeva</em>). Avid birdwatchers will enjoy the myriad bird species known from the Panamints. Lastly, if we are lucky, the group will have an opportunity to see desert bighorn sheep.</p> 
<p class="workshopBody">Participants should be in good physical condition for this workshop: hikes will be strenuous, through exposed, uneven terrain at elevations above 8,000 feet, in potentially extreme weather conditions, with distances up to 14 miles and 3,000-foot elevation gain. Participants will need to carry at least one gallon of water on hikes. Limited transportation may be available during the workshop. Please contact the herbarium for more information.</p>

  <p class="workshopBody"> Since Drs. Sawyer and Thornburgh surveyed the eastern escarpment of the Salmon-Scott Mountains in the 1960s and '70s, this rugged and diverse landscape has received much attention from botanists and ecologists. The uniqueness of the area, containing 17 conifer species in one square mile, has led to special land designations (Botanical Special Interest Area and Research Natural Area) by the managing agency, Klamath National Forest. This workshop will explore both upland and wetland habitats in search of (some of) the 414 plant species known to occur in this special place.</p> 
 
			<p class="workshopBody">John Sawyer will give a  lecture on Thursday evening to provide an overview of the area and flora. We'll camp near the town of Etna, and on Friday morning pack animals will carry our gear as we take a moderate four-mile hike at a leisurely pace up to our campsite, stopping along the way to rest and explore the montane mixed conifer and Engelmann spruce forests.</p> 
                <p class="workshopBody">The rest of Friday and Saturday will be devoted to ridge and lake basin explorations. In addition to conifers-including <em>Juniperus communis</em> subsp. <em>saxatilis</em> and the rare-in-California subalpine fir (<em>Abies lasiocarpa</em>)-- we can expect to see herbaceous species such as  California bog asphodel (<em>Narthecium californicum</em>), white marsh marigold (<em>Caltha leptosepala</em>), Salmon Mountain wakerobin (<em>Trillium ovatum</em> subsp. <em>oettingeri</em>), sundew (<em>Drosera rotundifolia</em>), and mycotrophic plants such as sugar stick (<em>Allotropa virgata</em>), snow plant (<em>Sarcodes sanquinea</em>), and phantom orchid (<em>Cephalanthera austiniae</em>). The uplands surrounding the lake basin provide opportunities to botanize in montane chaparral and meadows and to discuss the autecological characteristics of the conifer species and factors leading to their distributions across the landscape. We will spend Sunday morning botanizing before hiking out Sunday afternoon.</p> 
            <p class="workshopBody">Throughout the workshop, we will take selective collections to augment the Klamath National Forest herbarium. Camp support, including pack animals and cooking, will be provided by Trail Blazers, a local company of experienced backcountry packers and cooks. Participants should be prepared for several miles of easy to moderate hiking over uneven terrain in potentially hot areas each day, with an optional strenuous hike to High Lake in search of foxtail pine (<em>Pinus balfouriana</em>) and whitebark pine (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>) for hardy souls who like to traverse steep and rugged ridge systems.</p> 
 
	<p class="workshopBody">Course fee $490/$515 includes instruction, pack animal support, campsite fees, and meals from Thursday dinner through Sunday lunch. Our wilderness campsite has potable water, solar showers, and temporary pit toilets with seats. Participants who wish to carry their own personal gear into and out of camp may deduct $60 from the course fee.</p>

We will focus on the South Warner area, which contains the highest point in the range, Eagle Peak, at 9,892'. From a Forest Service campground base camp at approximately 6800' elevation, we will go on day trips to explore and learn about a variety of plant habitats including sagebrush, mixed conifer forests, gravelly ridgetops, fens, and riparian areas. We will also visit forests of whitebark pine (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>), a species currently under review by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for possible Federal listing. Some of the species we'll look for include Modoc bedstraw (<em>Galium glabrescens</em> subsp. <em>modocense</em>), Warner Mountain bedstraw (<em>Galium serpenticum</em> subsp. <em>warnerense</em>), bog birch (<em>Betula glandulosa</em>), spiked larkspur (<em>Delphinium stachydeum</em>), doublet <em>(Dimeresia howellii</em>), blue camas (<em>Camassia quamash</em>), Butte candle (<em>Cryptantha celosioides</em>), blue alpine phacelia (<em>Phacelia sericea</em> subsp. <em>ciliosa</em>), and kittentails (<em>Synthyris missurica</em> subsp.<em> missurica</em>).

  <p class="workshopBody">At summer's end, lowland botanizing is largely long gone . . . at least on dry land. In, on, and around the various lakes, streams, and other wetlands, however, delightfully diverse aquatic plants are still going strong. For those willing to get their feet muddy, a whole new world of botanizing opens up, with a high probability of finding new occurrence records with relative ease. Because of the broad spectrum of plants that will be covered, the workshop will focus more on gaining familiarity with aquatic plant diversity than on keys to species. We will use fresh material and illustrations of diagnostic characteristics of families and genera in the classroom. A field trip to a selection of local wetlands will give us a chance to practice field identification.</p>

			<p class="workshopBody">Plant galls provide a fascinating array of color and texture on most of the plants in our California landscape. Galls, growths of plant cells that are not normal plant organs, can be induced by a number of organisms. The most numerous as well as most beautiful and intriguing are those induced by insects. Two insect families are found only in plant galls: Cynipidae (gall wasps) and Cecidomyiidae (gall midges or gnats). Plant galls also host a whole ecology of other insects, including herbivorous inquilines and carnivorous parasitoids like the wasp family Ormyridae, which is found only in plant galls. Most of these organisms are too small for us to see, so that the only thing we notice is the colorful gall growth itself.</p> 
 
			<p class="workshopBody">In this workshop, we will start by exploring the diversity of extant insect-induced plant galls and some of the community of species to be found within them. We will begin our study indoors, using some of Joyce Gross's excellent photographic images of galls and gall insects. Then, we will take a short campus field trip to learn how to find galls; many do occur on plants common in California gardens. We will then dissect and examine galls under microscopes to tease out the development and origins of the gall tissue layers. We will wrap up with discussion about the evolution of the plant host-plant galler interrelationships with examples from fossil galls.</p>
