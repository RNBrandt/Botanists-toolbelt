been captivated by plants since my first gardening plot at
Heatherdown School in the late 70’s. I later was assigned gardening
tasks as ‘punishment’ at Charterhouse school in the 80’s. Over
the years I have moved from living to preserved collections but still
keep one foot in each field. I have worked in commercial
horticulture, historic gardens and the nursery/landscape business for
over 15 years and moved into collections administration and
management 14 years ago after pursuing a botany focused direction at
University.</FONT></P>

of my landscape projects as a freelance landscaper was the
construction of this terraced garden in Godalming using local bargate
stone. The problem with this project was access to remove </FONT><FONT COLOR="#333333"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">25

by buckets and wheel barrows down many flights of stairs to create

All top soil was reused and a further 50 tonnes went up hill to level

came to U. C. Berkeley from the University of Connecticut, Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology where I was the Scientific
Collections Manager in the Herbarium but in addition became the
Curator of the Campus Arboretum. At UConn I moved and rearranged the
herbarium and introduced a new phase of specimen digitization,
including type specimens, relational links to protologues, collectors,
loans and high resolution images. I have pursued a similar direction
at Berkeley. I still maintain close links with UConn and facilitated
the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://bgbaseserver.eeb.uconn.edu">CONN
herbarium</A> to utilize <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://code.google.com/p/berkeleymapper/">BerkeleyMapper</A>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">Prior
to UConn I worked at Denver Botanic Gardens as a Horticultural
Taxonomist and Plant Records Manager, which involved completely
redeveloping the gardens labeling system and the crucial database
behind it. This involved working closely with the horticulturists
responsible for gardens records. Before moving to the United States I
enjoyed brief spells at the Royal Horticultural Society’s
<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://www.rhs.org.uk/science">Department of
Botany</A> at Wisley. While there I worked on their horticultural

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">Since
moving to U. C. Berkeley I have expanded and funded our digitization
and curatorial activities beyond California. Starting with our type
specimen project shortly after my arrival, the herbaria now has
digitized over 10,000 types. All of these are linked to protologues
at the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://plants.jstor.org">JStor Plant

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">I
am fascinated with the wealth of archival materials at Berkeley that
not only pertain to botany, but also transcend it in many areas. This
led me to obtain funding to document these unique and hidden
resources. Assisted by the wealth of institutional knowledge our
successful application led to the creation of our <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/archon/">on-line
archives catalog</A>, the creation of an archivist/librarian position
and a new era for the use of our archives in conjunction with our
specimens. This year the Institute of Museum and Library Services
funded compactor shelving for our library and archives. I am
currently moving and rearranging the collections to temporary storage
with the help of our Librarian. This will provide much needed space and
access for our collections.</FONT></P>

vascular plants have received a lot of support over the last twenty
years. However our cryptogammic collections are now receiving the
attention they deserve with multiple National Science Foundation
grants funding seaweed, lichen, bryophyte and macrofungi imaging and
digitization. This has led to revising our workflows and procedures,
some of which have been in place for decades. It also made necessary
the complete redesign of our database, something with which I am
intimately involved. Working with our <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://www.collectionspace.org">CollectionSpace</A>
partners and Berkeley Information Services and Technology, we are
using the above projects to test and develop the new system to
replace our old database.</FONT></P>

University &amp; Jepson Herbaria continue to grow and I have overseen
the acquisition and integration of a number of collections over the
last 6 years. This began in 2006 with the second half of the Los
Angeles County Museum cryptogams, swiftly followed by the historic
<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/god">Charterhouse

I like most about working for the University &amp; Jepson Herbaria is
promoting the collections to a diverse range of users, from
systematists to civil war researchers. We could never have predicted
100 years ago that specimens would now be used for molecular and
climate change studies and using these collections we really can go
back in time to observe historical changes in the flora. My goals at
Berkeley are to integrate these collections internally and externally
worldwide to provide tools for wider exposure of our collections to a
diverse range of people and uses.</FONT></P>
