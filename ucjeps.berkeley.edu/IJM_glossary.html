GLOSSARY
</h3>


<P>
One of the main goals of the Jepson eFlora is to facilitate plant identification, which often relies on extremely subtle differences in plant characters. The terminology used in the Jepson eFlora is constrained to make the work accessible to a broad audience. All users are encouraged to routinely consult the glossary, and beginners are encouraged to study the glossary,  as a way to acquire the basic botanical knowledge needed to identify plants.
