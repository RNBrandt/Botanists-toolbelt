            <p class="bodyText">Kim Richard Kersh has worked on the Collections Management staff of the University and Jepson Herbaria since 2001. He has been active in significant expansion of the cryptogamic collections, and is especially interested in bryophytes. He also works in collections management generally, working with herbarium specimens, the specimen database, assisting visitors, and working with volunteers. With the other members of the collections management staff, he supports the specimen-based efforts of the Jepson Online Interchange for California Floristics and production of the upcoming Second Edition of the Jepson Manual. He is contributor to the Manual for the genera <i>Scrophularia </i>and <i>Bacopa</i>.</p>

<p class="bodyText">
     
    Kim comes to herbarium curation and plant studies from an academic background in music performance, music theory and composition, and musicology. He plays violin and guitar, and has a B.A. degree in Music from UC Davis. He has done extensive independent research on 11th and 12th century central Italian manuscripts, under the direction of Richard L. Crocker, Professor Emeritus, UC Berkeley. Modal and notational characteristics were studied to help reconstruct the evolution of a fragmentarily preserved manuscript tradition. There are interesting similarities in conceptualizing the course of development of European melodic and manuscript traditions and reconstructing phylogenies of plant groups.</p>
		
		
		<p class="bodyText">An enthusiastic backpacker and hiker, Kim is a member of the California Native Plant Society, serves on the Rare Plants Committee of the East Bay Chapter of CNPS, and is a member of the California Botanical Society. He has a strong commitment to the study and conservation of the California flora.</p>
