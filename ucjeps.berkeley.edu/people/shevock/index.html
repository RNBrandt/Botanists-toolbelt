<!-- My research interests currently are focused on moss floristics of western North America and China. My field work shifted around 1997 from flowering plants to bryophytes with an emphasis in bryogeography and floristics. Nine plant species have been named in my honor including three mosses and the moss genus Shevockia. One of my most valuable contributions to science is my set of herbarium specimens currently with over 32,000 numbers obtained from western North America (especially California and Nevada), China, Taiwan, and Korea. All of my flowering plant collections are housed at CAS and for my bryophyte collections, the first set is housed at CAS with many duplicates at MO, NY, and UC. A complete set of my Yunnan Province, China collections reside at E, KUN and MO with many duplicates at H, NY, PE and UC, and a set of my Taiwan collections are at the Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute, Ji-Ji, Nantou County, Taiwan (TAIE) and also at MO and UC. Ongoing bryological research is focused in the  mountainous region of Yunnan Province along the border with Myanmar in the Nu Jiang (Salween) and Irrawaddy river basins.<br />

I received my B.S. (1976) and M.A. (1978) in Botany from California State Univ., Long Beach. Upon graduation, I began my federal career as the botanist/ecologist with the USDA Forest Service, Sequoia National Forest (1979-84). In 1984 I accepted at 2-year assignment approved by the Secretary of Agriculture to assist the California Department of Fish & Game as botanist of its Natural Diversity Database. In 1986, I was then promoted to Regional Botanist for the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region stationed at that time in San Francisco (now Mare Island, Vallejo, CA) where I administered the sensitive and rare plant program across 18 national forests in California. In 1998 I departed the Forest Service for a new opportunity to serve as the Associate Regional Director for Resources, Stewardship & Science for the USDI National Park Service, Pacific West Region, headquartered in  San Francisco (now in Oakland, CA). On February 1, 2004 I began my new NPS role as research coordinator at the Californian Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit duty stationed at U.C. Berkeley. I officially retired from federal government service effective January 2, 2009. I have also been a research associate of the Department of Botany, California Academy of Sciences since 1983, and was elected as a Fellow in 2007. I have served as President, Corresponding Secretary and Council Member for the California Botanical Society, Member at Large with the American Bryological and Lichenological Society and as Vice President for Plant Programs with the California Native Plant Society.

			with Myanmar in the Nu Jiang (Salween) and Irrawaddy river basins.
			Another of my research interests is focused on the distribution
			and ecology of rheophytic bryophytes. These species are restricted
			to seasonally fast flowing rivers and streams where they are then
			exposed for various times of the year (usually the summer season)
			thereby requiring both the ability to be aquatic and deal with
			extended periods of desiccation on exposed rocks. The number of
			bryophytes that can be classified as "rheophytes" is probably
			less than 500 species worldwide. Rheophytes also have a distinct
			linear distribution pattern within the water column. Some
			rheophytes occur along the high water mark while others are
			submerged for extended periods forming distinct species zones.
			Part of the ongoing inventory of rheophytic bryophytes led to the
			discovery of a new rheophytic genus, </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#003366"><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><I>Yunnanobryo</I></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#003366"><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">n,
