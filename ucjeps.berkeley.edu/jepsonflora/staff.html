He is also interested in more general topics in the theoretical basis of systematic and evolutionary biology, such as the nature of species and measures of phylogenetic diversity.  He has been heavily involved in developing electronic resources to present plant taxonomic and distributional information to the public, and to apply these to conservation concerns.

Scott Simono has been with the Jepson Herbarium since 2006. He obtained his BS in botany at San Francisco State University, where he investigated the molecular systematic relationships of day and night blooming populations of Linanthus dichotomus, and studied the floristics of montane meadows of the northern Sierra Nevada. He returned to California after a brief exploration of graduate studies in molecular systematics at Cornell University and the New York Botanical Garden, to pursue his interest in California landscapes and flora.
