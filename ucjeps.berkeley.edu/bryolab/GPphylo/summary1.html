This workshop was the first of a series planned by the Green Plant 
Phylogeny Research Coordination Group (GPPRCG), sponsored by a 
grant from the DOE/NSF/USDA Joint Program on Collaborative 
Research in Plant Biology (USDA grant no. 94-37105-0713).  The 
GPPRCG was set up in September, 1994 with the aim of initiating and 
facilitating interaction world-wide among independent research 
groups interested in major patterns of relationship in green plants.  
This initiative is based on the insight that further progress in green 
plant phylogeny requires substantial, coordinated data collection 
from selected key taxa (exemplars).  Specific objectives of the group 
include coordination of data gathering; establishment of phylogenetic 
databases for use by researchers, teachers or students; stimulation of 
creative new approaches to investigating green plant phylogeny and 
related macroevolutionary issues; and encouragement of 
collaboration among research groups.
<P>
Ten workshops are scheduled over a five year period, and these will 
alternate between major North American scientific conferences and 
other independent venues. Coordination of research activity will be 
achieved principally through publication, via the World Wide Web, of 
data availability tables for exemplar taxa.  These tables will provide 
a readily accessible and up-to-date summary of the state of current 
knowledge on phylogenetically important plants.  They are also 
intended to highlight shortcomings in current knowledge and 
thereby provide a guide to researchers in the field.  
<P>
Whereas this initiative encourages coordination of research activity, 
the GPPRCG will not allocate discreet tasks to individuals or labs.  All 
researchers interested in plant phylogeny are encouraged to 
participate freely and equally and to contribute results to the data 
availability tables.  Investigators will publish and justify their own 
data in the normal way, so everybody will get credit for their own 
data (only independently published data will end up in the final data 
matrix).  Contributors will be invited to participate in an eventual 
publication that will attempt a complete and well-supported high-
level phylogenetic analysis of green plants.  This publication will take 
the form of a book, including multiauthored chapters along with the 
data matrix in electronic form (with all contributors acknowledged), 
which is scheduled for completion by the International Botanical 
Congress in St Louis, 1999.  This initiative is seen as complimentary 
to other World Wide Web based projects such as the 
<a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html">Tree of Life (http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html)</a>; 
and Tree Base (WWW address not yet specified).

The focus of this first workshop in Berkeley (hosted at the University 
and Jepson Herbaria by B.D. Mishler) was the Streptophyte clade 
which comprises embryophytes (land plants) and closely related 
charophycean green algae.  A second workshop on the Chlorophyte 
clade (i.e., the remainder of the green algae) was held in conjunction 
with the Phycological Society of America meeting at Breckenridge, CO 
(August 6-12, 1995). Financial considerations limited attendance at 
both workshops to invited participants who were chosen to represent 
a broad spectrum of expertise in systematics, data collection and data 
analysis.  Specific goals of both meetings included defining a list of 
key exemplar taxa for further data gathering, the establishment of 
an outline data matrix for these taxa, and the coordination of efforts 
at improving and analysing these data. For streptophytes, these main 
goals were successfully achieved at the Berkeley workshop.  Also 
discussed at that meeting were the objectives and strategy of the 
GPPRCG, accessibility and dissemination of data on green plant 
phylogeny, potential group products (e.g., publications), contacts with 
other major coordinated research efforts in the physics and biological 
communities, and potential additional sources of funding.  Following 
is a summary of the main findings from the Berkeley meeting  
(attended by 35 participants from 7 countries, see list below).
<P>
<b>Choice of exemplar taxa:</b> The use of exemplar taxa in phylogenetic 
analysis is a necessary compromise between sampling total biological 
diversity and setting achievable goals in terms of data collection and 
analysis.  A figure of 200-300 taxa was deemed sufficient for a 
coarse-grained analysis that would resolve broad level relationships 
in streptophytes. Exemplar choice was based on current phylogenetic 
hypotheses with the following additional  requirements: i) even 
sampling of diversity, ii) priority to  taxa with predominantly 
plesiomorphic states (i.e., exclusion of highly autapomorphic taxa), iii) 
inclusion of phylogenetically controversial taxa, iv) inclusion of taxa 
used as model systems in other branches of biology (e.g., crop  plants 
such as Oryza, Zea), v) inclusion of nomenclatural types, and vi) 
current availability of material and data. Four groups of systematists 
formulated a provisional list of exemplars (living and fossil) totalling 
some 320 taxa from charophycean algae (c. 20 taxa), liverworts and 
hornworts (c. 41 taxa), mosses (c. 60 taxa), and tracheophytes (c. 200 
taxa).  These 320 exemplars (to be listed on this WWW site) form a 
nucleus of taxa for coordinated data gathering activities in 
streptophytes.  In the context of the general analysis of streptophyte 
phylogeny, the exemplar list errs on the side of generosity (i.e., it 
probably over-samples group diversity). The relative importance of 
some of the exemplars was discussed and some were identified as 
being of secondary importance in the overall analysis.
<P>
<b>Outline data matrix:</b> Renewed interest in phylogenetic  relationships 
among green plants - stimulated by recent advances in systematic 
theory, data analysis and molecular biology - has led to a large, 
diverse and rapidly expanding phylogenetic database.  The problem 
of coordinating data gathering was addressed through the 
establishment of a data availability matrix (DAM) that is freely 
available through the Internet (but not yet).  Initially, the green 
plant DAM will take the form of a simple table that indicates the 
existence of data (published and unpublished) for all exemplar taxa 
(living and extinct).  The scope of this database will be extended in 
the future to include fields for comments and pointers to other 
entities such as literature citations and individual specialists or labs.  
Data domains are based on the interests of particular specialist 
groups (e.g., molecular, morphological).  These domains are further 
subdivided along speciality (e.g., rbcL (chloroplast), 18S rRNA 
(nuclear), spermatozoid ultrastructure, spore morphology, wood 
anatomy, floral morphology, etc.).  The green plant DAM summarises 
known data for exemplar taxa and highlights shortcomings in current 
knowledge and areas in need of further investigation.
<P>
<b>Additional databases:</b> General discussion at the Berkeley workshop 
highlighted the need for a number of additional databases.  These 
will also be included eventually on the World Wide Web page.  
Researchers interested in green plant phylogeny are invited to 
contribute data to the following: 1. A DNA availability matrix which 
will list published and unpublished sequences as well as information 
on planned sequencing projects including names and addresses of 
investigators. This source of information is intended as a guide to 
researchers planning new sequencing projects. 2. A primer list will 
document the availability of primers and list publications where they 
were first used. This database is intended to help researchers obtain 
the necessary primers for sequencing studies.  The primer list is 
being compiled by Bill Hahn of the Smithsonian Institution and Chuck 
Delwiche of Indiana University. 3. A culture availability matrix will 
list the location of  cultures of green algae.  This database is intended 
to aid  researchers in obtaining difficult taxa.
<P>
<b>Analytical and theoretical considerations:</b> The main goal of the 
GPPRCG is to develop a complete and well supported high-level 
phylogenetic hypothesis for green plants based on the total available 
evidence.  Workshop participants recognized that this goal presents a 
significant analytical challenge. One estimate placed the size of the 
1999 St Louis data matrix for green plants at 300-400 taxa with as 
many as 4,000-10,000 characters per taxon.  Parsimony-based tree 
searching algorithms are currently unable to guarantee a most 
parsimonious solution with data matrices of this size. Furthermore, it 
is unclear how best to approach the analysis using heuristic 
procedures. The ability to generate data is fast outstripping the 
capacity for analysis.
<P>
Other areas of difficulty with potential consequences for analysis 
include missing data and inapplicable character states. Missing data 
are likely to be a significant problem when dealing with fossils, 
primarily because molecular sequences are absent for these taxa.  
The large number of molecular characters in the green plant DAM 
will lead to large blocks of missing data for fossils.  Several 
participants noted that the problem of inapplicable morphological 
characters is difficult to avoid because they are a natural 
consequence of evolution in green plants.  One clear example of this 
problem relates to multicellular characters of more derived plants 
which do not apply in many basal lineages. How are seeds to be 
scored in Spirogyra and, carpels in Coleochaete? A number of ideas 
were considered including treating these as missing character states, 
as large multistate characters, or ignoring these data altogether in 
favour of "global characters" that are scorable in all taxa (e.g., 
molecular sequences, subcellular morphology, physiological and 
biochemical pathways). Each of these three alternatives is 
problematic. Treating inapplicable characters as missing data allows 
states to be assigned to non-existent characters which may lead to 
spurious relationships. Reformulating characters to avoid 
inapplicability leads to the apparently absurd notion of scoring the 
entire multicellular morphology of an angiosperm as a multitude of 
states within one character. Ignoring these problematic characters 
was an option that was strongly rejected by most participants 
because this would exclude relevant data, including the entire fossil 
record, and would remove most of the biologically interesting 
information from the analysis.
<P>
The group recommended that a future workshop should be  devoted 
to addressing these and other analytical/theoretical problems and 
that every effort should be made to encourage research in this area.

<b>Forthcoming meetings:</b>  Four future meetings of the GPPRCG will focus in greater detail on streptophyte subgroups. These meetings will be organised as workshops alongside symposia at major N. American conferences. Additional workshops will be held on a number of related topics including the fossil record, data analysis and research co-ordination.
