  <span class="bodyText"><strong>With a current combined total of over 2,200,000 accessioned specimens, </strong>
the University Herbarium and Jepson Herbarium represent the largest 
collection of herbarium material west of the Missouri Botanical Garden 
and the largest at a public university in the United States.  The 
relative proximity of this collection to that of the California Academy 
of Sciences (ca. 1,600,000 specimens, including the Dudley Herbarium from 
Stanford University), which maintains close collaborative ties, makes the 
San Francisco Bay Area the unrivaled center of plant systematic and 
floristic studies in the western United States.  All plant groups are 
represented, with particular strengths in marine algae, bryophytes, and 
pteridophytes in addition to spermatophytes, as are all geographic areas, 
with strengths in western North America, Mexico, Andean South America, 
and eastern Asia.  </span>
<p><span class="bodyText"> The initial core of the collection is the "large and full suite" of 
botanical specimens obtained from the Geological Survey of California 
undertaken by the new state in the 1860's.  This is currently the only 
set of these early collections, mostly by William H. Brewer and Henry N. 
Bolander, on the West Coast.  Included are numerous isotypes and other 
material critical for studies of western botany. </span>

Brewer was named Professor of Natural Science of the private  <a 
href="/gifs/college_of_calif.html" class="normalLink"> College of California</a> in 1863, 
but returned to Yale shortly thereafter.  The College became the 
University in 1868, with Joseph Le Conte serving as Professor of Geology, 
Natural History, and Botany.  For the next two decades, botany courses 
were generally taught by associates of other institutions (e.g., the 
fledgling California Academy of Sciences):  Hans Behr, Albert Kellogg, 
Edward Lee Greene, and Charles E. Bessey (as a visiting Lecturer from 
Iowa Agricultural College), among others.	Greene became Instructor of 
Botany in 1885, the first strictly botanical appointee.  In 1890 the 
Department of Botany was established within the new College of Natural 
Sciences; the herbarium was initiated at the same time.  Greene resigned 
ten years later to become Professor of Botany at the Catholic University 
of America in Washington, D.C., taking most of his collections with him 
(and subsequently to Notre Dame University).  As a
result, types of the numerous species Greene described during this 
exploratory period of California botany are primarily in the Greene 
Herbarium at Notre Dame; others, however, are scattered among the 
University Herbarium, the California Academy of Science, and the various 
herbaria that acquired portions of the dispersed Catholic University 
herbarium.

<a href="/gifs/setchell.html" class="normalLink">William Albert Setchell</a> replaced 
Greene in 1895, serving also as Chairman of the department.  He 
officially established the University Herbarium (the oldest natural 
history museum on campus) and set the department on its way to achieving 
national and international distinction during his 40-year tenure.  His 
retirement in 1934, coinciding with Gardner's and followed shortly by 
Jepson's in 1937, marked the end of an era in the Botany Department.  </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
Setchell's primary interest was marine algae; vascular plants were the 
responsibility of Joseph Burtt&nbsp;Davy, Willis Linn Jepson, and Harvey 
Monroe Hall.  During Setchell's tenure, Townshend S. and Katharine 
Brandegee donated their extensive library and herbarium of 76,000 
specimens, including the valuable exsiccatae of Carl A. Purpus with a 
wealth of Mexican types.  Hall resigned as Curator in 1919 to join the 
Department of Plant Biology of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 
there to preside over the famous transplant studies.  He was succeeded at 
Berkeley by phycologist Nathaniel L. Gardner, who served as Curator of 
the Herbarium until 1934.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">  
A strength in east Asia (especially China) and the Pacific Basin, in the 
form of ca. 110,000 specimens, resulted from the five-year tenure of 
Elmer D. Merrill as Dean of Agriculture.  In addition to his own 
collections, these specimens included significant collections by A. D. E. 
Elmer, J. Clemens, and J. F. C. Rock.  Many of these specimens are 
potential lectotypes and neotypes as a
result of the destruction of the Philippine National Herbarium during 
World War II.  Merrill came to the University from the Philippine Bureau 
of Science in 1924 and left in 1929 to become director of the New York 
Botanical Garden.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
Andean South America became a strength when T. Harper Goodspeed, director 
of the University Botanical Garden, launched a series of Andean 
Expeditions from 1935 to 1949 in conjunction with his studies on 
    <i>Nicotiana.</i> Vouchers of over 35,000 collections, including numerous 
new species, were deposited in the University Herbarium.  Goodspeed 
published an account ofthe expeditions in his book, <i>Plant Hunters in 
the Andes.</i>  Paul Hutchison continued collecting in the Andes for 
several decades more.

<span class="bodyText"><a href="/gifs/mason.html" class="normalLink">
Herbert L. Mason</a> served as Director of 
the Herbarium for thirty years (1933-1963).  During his directorship, the 
size of the collections doubled, service to the University and the public 
was promoted, and the role of the herbarium broadened beyond academic 
research.  Notable acquisitions during this period included the vouchers 
for the Vegetation Type Map of California, Ira W. Clokey's collection of 
ca. 100,000 specimens from the western United States, Joseph P. Tracy's 
50,000 specimens from northwestern California, and the collections of 
Annie Alexander and Louise Kellogg from the western American desert 
ranges.  </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
The Mason plan of organization was based on a faculty member as Curator 
for each of the major divisions of the plant kingdom, each Curator to be 
supported by a Herbarium Botanist who would take responsibility for the 
appropriate collections in the Herbarium, as well as perform other 
assigned duties.  These non-faculty positions became increasingly 
critical to the herbarium as the
emphasis in the Botany Department shifted toward molecular and cellular 
approaches.  By the end of Mason's tenure there were faculty Curators 
only for algal (<a href="/gifs/papenfuss.html" class="normalLink">George F. Papenfuss</a>) 
and seed plant collections (Lincoln Constance).  Lee Bonar curated the 
fungi as Emeritus Professor; the ferns had been uncurated since Edwin B. 
Copeland's death.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
Under Mason, the number of professional herbarium botanists increased 
from two to five, with both curatorial duties and research interests. 
These consisted of Margaret Bergseng (filing and loans; Violaceae), <a 
href="/gifs/carter.html" class="normalLink"> Annetta Carter</a> (general administration; 
Baja California flora), Helen Sharsmith (exchange and public service; 
California flora), <a href="/people/silva_obit.html" class="normalLink"> Paul Silva</a> 
(herbarium library; algae), and Isabelle Tavares (accessions; fungi).  
Previous herbarium botanists and other affiliated researchers included 
Floy Bracelin, Marion Cave (cytogenetics), Ethel Crum (<i>Potentilla</i>),
Harriet Walker, Vera Miller (mycology), and Helen Mar Wheeler
(<i>Nicotiana</i>).
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
Lincoln Constance, who had just served as Vice Chancellor (1962-65), 
succeeded Mason as Director of the Herbarium from 1963 to 1975.  
Constance successfully transferred most of the key herbarium positions 
into the professional Research Botanist series.  These were academic 
positions where research counted toward promotion, in contrast to the 
previous non-academic Museum Scientist series.  Silva and Larry Heckard 
(Jepson Herbarium) were promptly reclassified to the new series.  
Tavares, because of a different funding source from the College of 
Natural Resources, entered the Specialist series, also an academic 
classification.  When Bergsang retired in 1967, and Carter in 1968, their 
positions were filled at the new classifications by <a 
href="/people/strother.html" class="normalLink"> John L. Strother</a> and <a 
href="/people/smith.html" class="normalLink"> Alan Smith</a>.  Carter's administrative 
duties were taken over by Administrative Assistant Alice Howard 
(previously Secretary, later reclassified to Senior Museum Scientist), 
who also became increasingly involved in the grounds well interest in 
California rare plants and conservation issues.  Curatorial duties were 
divided among the academic staff: Silva (algal and "wet stack" curation 
and public service; library curation, including Gray Index Cards and 
Index Nominum Genericorum), Smith (pteridophyte and grass curation and 
public service; vascular plant loans; supervision of student research 
assistants), Strother (vascular plant exchange and public service; 
supervision of preparators), and Tavares (curation and public service for 
mycology, lichens, and bryophytes; accession records). </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
This period coincided with an extreme space shortage, such that the newly 
recruited young research staff had little more than desks in the corners 
of crowded herbarium stacks.  As one result, the candidate selected by 
the review committee to replace Sharsmith, who retired in 1969, rejected 
the offer, citing lack of suitable office space as one reason (the 
candidate later became
Herbarium Director at the New York Botanical Garden, Patricia Kern 
Holmgren).  Unfortunately, the position was frozen during subsequent lean 
years and never filled.  One of four student research assistant positions 
was also lost, and one of three preparator positions was replaced with a 
Museum Scientist (<a href="/people/tang.html" class="normalLink">Tom Tang</a>) to assist 
with cryptogamic curation.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
The extreme space restrictions also led to a policy of curtailed 
accessions.  Growth occurred primarily in conjunction with research 
specialties: Apiaceae (Constance), Latin American Asteraceae (Strother), 
and pteridophytes (Smith).  The continued collecting activities of Carter 
further established a strength in Baja California, Mexico, during this 
period.
</span>
<p>
  <span class="bodyText"><a href="/people/ornduff.html" class="normalLink">Robert Ornduff</a>, Acting Director when 
Constance was on sabbatical leave, formally assumed the directorship in 
1975.  One particularly significant acquisition during Ornduff's tenure 
was the transfer of a large part of Carl Epling's specimens of Labiatae, 
including many holotypes, from UCLA to UC in1977.  Ornduff continued 
until 1982, when the conflicting demands of serving also as director of 
the Botanical Garden became too time-consuming.  The directorship passed 
to Thomas Duncan, who had replaced Constance on the Botany Department 
staff after his retirement in 1976.  </span>
<p><span class="bodyText"> Under the directorship of Duncan (1982-1991) and with the assistance of 
successive NSF grants, the herbarium entered a new period of activity 
marked by computerization and staff reorganization.  By reducing the 
percent time of the staff illustrator and cryptogamic curatorial 
assistant, a new position was created to oversee the new computer 
hardware and software, and to assist herbarium staff in making the 
transition.  Progress toward eventual computerization began with the 
databasing of selected curatorial records (loans, accessions) and subsets 
of the collections (types, fruit &amp; cone collection). </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
Also, in response to recommendations resulting from previous NSF grant 
applications, general curatorial duties of the research staff were 
consolidated in a newly defined Collections Manager position, replacing 
Alice Howard in 1985.  In that major renovation was scheduled for the 
Berkeley herbaria, <a href="/people/ertter.html" class="normalLink"> Barbara Ertter's</a> 
recent experience with designing and relocating the herbaria of the 
University of Texas at Austin was a significant factor in her recruitment 
for this position.  Ertter's collecting efforts in the western United 
States also briefly revitalized the accession and exchange programs.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
When Duncan's tenure ended in 1991, he became faculty director of the 
fledgling Museum Informatics Project (MIP), coinciding with approval of 
NSF funding for a far-ranging program to begin computerization of the 
data associated with specimens from California in herbaria throughout the 
state, the Specimen Management System for California Herbaria (SMASCH).
Former Vice Chancellor Roderic Park, a Plant Biology faculty member, 
became Acting Director.  Park appointed John L. Strother, who had been 
Acting Director during Duncan's 1991 sabbatical, to be Deputy Director in 
charge of internal matters.  After a 2-year search, bryologist <a 
href="/people/mishler.html" class="normalLink"> Brent D. Mishler</a> took over the 
Directorship in July 1993, arriving from Duke University with several 
graduate students and a commitment to remain at the fore front of 
systematic research.	The transition period between directors coincided 
with several other major events affecting the herbaria.  First was the 
massive reorganization of Biological Sciences initiated in 1980, which 
resulted in the dismantling of the Department of Botany and the 
affiliation of the autonomous herbaria with the new <a 
href="http://IB.berkeley.edu" class="normalLink"> Department of Integrative Biology,</a> 
separate from the Department of Plant Biology.  Second, the long-planned 
total renovation of the Life Sciences Building resulted in herbaria and 
staff being transferred to off-campus facilities in 1989, returning to 
modernized quarters at the end of1994.  Third, a major statewide 
recession triggered sequential budget cuts, buffered by Park's efforts 
but nevertheless eventually resulting in the loss of staff artist and 
some curatorial support staff.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
At the same time, on-going recruitment efforts continued to prove 
successful.  As one of Mishler's first actions, he negotiated with Daniel 
H. Norris to relocate to Berkeley, bringing with him his extensive 
personal collection of bryophytes.  With a new Director in place, the 
search for a new Jepson Curator (vacant since Heckard's untimely death in 
1991) could begin, resulting in the recruitment of <a 
href="/people/baldwin.html" class="normalLink"> Bruce Baldwin</a> (Asteraceae: Madiinae; 
molecular systematics) in 1994.  At the same time, Ertter became a 
Research Botanist with the title of Curator of Western North American 
Flora.  Tavares retired in late 1993; the search for her replacement is 
still ongoing.

href="../biog/jepson/jepson_obit.html" class="normalLink"> Willis Linn Jepson,</a> the first doctoral 
graduate from the Botany Department (1898) and then a professor until 
1937.  His <i>Manual of the Flowering Plants of California</i> (1925) was 
the primary reference on the subject for over thirty years.  Recent 
donations from supporters of the Jepson Herbarium have added 
significantly to the original endowment.  </span>
  <p><span class="bodyText">
The core of the herbarium consists of Jepson's personal collections and 
other vouchers for his Manual and Flora.  Subsequent additions have 
largely been collections made by JEPS staff members or sent to them for 
verification, especially by native plant enthusiasts.  In addition to the 
plant collections, the Jepson Herbarium also includes a diversity of 
other resources, including the
Jepson library and archives.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
The intent of Jepson's bequest was to further his work on the systematics 
of vascular plants of California in particular and western North America 
in general.  The first curators, <a href="/gifs/rimo.html" class="normalLink"> Rimo 
Bacigalupi</a> (1950-1968) and <a href="/gifs/heckard.html" class="normalLink"> Lawrence R. 
Heckard</a> (1968-1991), focused on families left undone in Jepson's 
ambitious multi-volume <i>Flora of California</i>, primarily 
Scrophulariaceae.  The Jepson Herbarium has also continued to be a 
critical link between academia and a burgeoning interest in native flora 
exemplified by the California Native Plant Society.  Another of Jepson's 
desires was fulfilled in 1993, which marked the culmination of a ten-year 
project to revise Jepson's Manual, under the editorship of James C. 
Hickman.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
In 1994, Bruce Baldwin became the most recent Jepson Curator, the first 
research appointment in either herbarium with adjunct faculty status 
(Integrative Biology).  In addition to research on tarweeds and teaching 
responsibilities, Baldwin became chair of an editorial board to oversee
the production of the next edition of the <i>Manual</i> and future 
electronic versions.  Baldwin's appointment also coincided with a 
resurgence in public education and outreach activities of the Jepson 
Herbarium, beginning with a symposium in June 1994 and followed by a 
series of weekend workshops.

<span class="pageName">Special Collections</span><br /><br />

<span class="bodyText">a. <b>Pteridophyte Collection</b>.  The University Herbarium includes one 
of the premier pteridophyte collections in the country.  Initial credit 
for this emphasis goes to Edwin B. Copeland, who was induced to come to 
Berkeley in 1927 by Merrill, Copeland's former associate in the 
Philippines.  Copeland remained on the staff as Research Associate until 
1957.  His personal herbarium, comprising 25,000 sheets and especially 
rich in Asian and Pacific Basin ferns,
was eventually purchased by the University of Michigan at the urging of 
W. H. Wagner, Jr., who was greatly influenced by Copeland while a student 
at Berkeley (Ph.D., 1950).	Fortunately, a significant set of duplicates 
and some archival material remained at Berkeley, forming a solid core 
around which was built a new pteridological strength.  Since 
<a href="/people/smith.html" class="normalLink"> Alan R. 
Smith</a>'s arrival in 1969, the pteridological tradition has been continued, 
largely as a result of gifts sent for determination (ca. 50,000).  These 
specimens have been received in conjunction with Smith's participation in 
the treatment of pteridophytes for various floras, particularly 
Neotropical ones.</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
b. <b>Bryophyte Collections</b>.  The basis of the bryological collection 
was formed by the liverworts and mosses collected by <a 
href="/gifs/howe.html" class="normalLink"> Marshall Avery Howe</a> and Frederick T. 
Bioletti in the early 1890's, vouchers for Howe's "Hepatics and 
Anthocerotes of California".  Exchange specimens included bryophytes 
collected by Bolander as part of the California Geological Survey, mosses 
from Elizabeth G. Britton and Clara Eaton Cummings, and exsiccatae such 
as Grout's "North American Musci Pleurocarpi".  Further acquisitions 
include California collections of hepatics and mosses donated by various 
botanists, including Annetta Carter.  In addition to California, the 
herbarium encompasses a broad selection of specimens from Canada, north 
and central Europe, Japan, western South America, Burma, Central America, 
and the West Indies. </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
This existing core was effectively tripled in 1993, with the donation of 
Daniel H. Norris's personal herbarium of about 85,000 bryophytes, 
collected in a number of regions around the world during the last several 
decades.  This fine collection greatly strengthens efforts to produce a 
bryophyte flora for California as well as general research in worldwide 
systematic studies.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
University and Jepson Herbaria Director <a href="/people/mishler.html" class="normalLink"> 
Brent D. Mishler</a>, a faculty 
member in Integrative Biology, has developed an active research and 
training program in the phylogeny, ecology, and biosystematics of 
bryophytes.  He currently supervises four graduate students and several 
foreign visitors and post-docs who are actively using and enhancing the 
collections.
</span>
<p>
  <span class="bodyText"><b>	d. Phycology Collections.</b>  In 1892 the first phycological 
collections were acquired when Marshall Avery Howe, who taught 
cryptogamic botany during Greene's tenure, presented to the University 
the specimens from his field work on the Monterey Peninsula.  The 1895 
appointment of William A.Setchell as Chairman of the Botany Department 
ushered in a period ofsustained
growth in the phycological collections that is still in progress. 
Setchell's student Nathaniel L. Gardner, who became both a faculty member 
and curator of the herbarium, continued this interest in phycology. 
Setchell and Gardner both retired in 1934, but a phycological focus was 
reactivated by George F. Papenfuss during the 1940's.  In 1960 Papenfuss 
brought in his former student <a href="/people/silva_obit.html" class="normalLink"> Paul C.
Silva</a> as an assistant.  Following Papenfuss's retirement in 1971, Silva 
has maintained the herbarium's phycological strength as research botanist 
in charge of algal curation, with the assistance of specialist 
<a href="/people/moe.html" class="normalLink"> Richard L. 
Moe</a> and a diversity of visiting scholars, post-doctoral students, and 
other research affiliates. In 1994 Silva and Moe's involvement in 
nomenclatural issues inspired the establishment of a Center for 
Phycological Documentation.  </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
The majority of phycology specimens have resulted from field work of 
faculty and former students, primarily Setchell (California, Alaska, 
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, South Africa, and tropical Pacific 
Islands), Gardner (Pacific Coast of North America), E. Yale Dawson 
(Pacific Ocean basin), Papenfuss (South Africa, East Africa, Red Sea, 
Indonesia, New Zealand), Silva (Pacific Ocean basin), Sylvia Earle 
(Caribbean and Indo- Pacific), Moe (Antarctica), and Kathy Ann Miller 
(Channel Islands, Alaska, and Antarctica).  Specimens from other 
collectors, including
many historical collections from European herbaria, have accrued as a 
result of an active exchange program.	Because of the University 
Herbarium's status as of one of the premier phycological collections in 
the country, it has also become the repository of phycology specimens of 
other herbaria.  In 1972, ca. 87,000 specimens from the Missouri 
Botanical Garden (MO in UC) and ca. 1,000 from the California Academy of 
Sciences and Dudley Herbarium of Stanford University (CAS-DS in UC) were 
deposited at Berkeley, further enhancing existing, historically important 
collections.
</span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
e.  <b>Fungus and Lichen Collections.</b> The mycological collections 
began with the deposition of fungi in 1892 by Walter Charles Blasdale, an 
assistant in cryptogamic botany, and the receipt of exchange from Thomas 
Jonathan Burrill in Illinois and Charles H. Peck.  Numerous additional 
exsiccati were subsequently accumulated, such as Sydow's "Mycotheca 
Germanica" and George P. Clinton's supplement to the Economic Fungi of 
Seymour and Earle, both received in 1904.  Ongoing exchange with other 
institutions has resulted in the acquisitions of large numbers of 
northern European fungi, as well as smaller collections from Brazil, 
Australia, and other areas. </span>
<p><span class="bodyText">
In-house collecting activities were initiated by Setchell and Gardner, 
who made extensive collections of fungi (as well as algae) in the San 
Francisco Bay area from 1901 to 1920, concentrating on hypogeous fungi. 
The collections of Harold E. Parks, mostly of hypogeous fungi and 
parasites of vascular plants, make up a particularly large part of the 
fungus herbarium. The strength of the mycological collection was firmly 
established by Lee Bonar, who collected and
described numerous California fungi from the 1920's to the 1970's.  He 
also compiled invaluable indices on parasitic fungi and their host plants 
in California, used by the California Department of Food and Agriculture.  
This and other projects have been continued by Isabelle Tavares, along 
with her own specialties in lichens and the Laboulbeniales.  The 
mycological holdings were further strengthened when the collections of 
lichenologist Thomas Elliot Weier were donated to the herbarium.
