<em>August 2000 <P> Message from the Coordinators</em><P>
<br>
<blockquote>
The Jepson Herbarium, celebrating its 50th Anniversary this year, carries
on Professor Willis Linn Jepson's life work studying the plants of
California. Decades of scientific research led to the 1993 publication of
<i>The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California</i>. Since that time,
research in the herbarium has focused on the evolutionary relationships of
several groups of California plants and we are continuing to publish works
that lead to a greater appreciation of our rich botanical heritage.
<P>
In addition to scientific research, the Jepson Herbarium offers a series of
botanical workshops.  The public programs, supported by The Friends of the
Jepson Herbarium, are designed to provide members of the systematic,
ecological, and conservation communities access to specialists in their
field of study.  The instructors who teach our classes are a wonderful
resource for the Herbarium and the public and we are grateful for their
contributions to our program. The classes are designed to accommodate
botanical enthusiasts ranging from beginners to specialists.  The Basic
Botany Series is designed for participants with little or no botanical
background.  This season our classes will provide an introduction to the
Plant Kingdom and the identification of Plant Families.  The Weekend
Workshop Series is designed for biological consultants, federal and state
agency employees, botanists, ecologists, conservationists, educators, and
interested amateurs.  The content of the workshops is technical and the
level of instruction will assume that participants have a general
understanding of the subject matter.  For the artists among us, we are
offering an introductory Botanical Illustration course designed to
accommodate participants with a variety of interests and skills.  Lastly,
this season, we are planning an exciting ten day floristic excursion to
Ecuador.
<P>
We hope you will join us as we begin our seventh season continuing to
explore, learn about, and admire California's unique and fascinating flora.
